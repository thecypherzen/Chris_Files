One morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled dreams, he found himself transformed in his bed into a horrible vermin. He lay on his armour-like back, and if he lifted his head a little he could see his brown belly, slightly domed and divided by arches into stiff sections. The bedding was hardly able to cover it and seemed ready to slide off any moment. His many legs, pitifully thin compared with the size of the rest of him, waved about helplessly as he looked. "What's happened to me? " he thought. It wasn't a dream. His room, a proper human room although a little too small, lay peacefully between its four familiar walls. A collection of textile samples lay spread out on the table - Samsa was a travelling salesman - and above it there hung a picture that he had recently cut out of an illustrated magazine and housed in a nice, gilded frame. It showed a lady fitted out with a fur hat and fur boa who sat upright, raising a heavy fur muff that covered the whole of her lower arm towards the viewer. Gregor then turned to look out the window at the dull weather. Drops of rain could be heard hitting the pane, which made him feel quite sad. "How about if I sleep a little bit longer and forget all this nonsense", he thought, but that was something he was unable to do because he was used to sleeping on his right, and in his present state couldn't get into that position. However hard he threw himself onto his right, he always rolled back to where he was. He must have tried it a hundred times, shut his eyes so that he wouldn't have to look at the floundering legs, and only stopped when he began to feel a mild, dull pain there that he had never felt before. "Oh, God", he thought, "what a strenuous career it is that I've chosen! Travelling day in and day out. Doing business like this takes much more effort than doing your own business at home, and on top of that there's the curse of travelling, worries about making train connections, bad and irregular food, contact with different people all the time so that you can never get to know anyone or become friendly with them. It can all go to Hell! " He felt a slight itch up on his belly; pushed himself slowly up on his back towards the headboard so that he could lift his head better; found where the itch was, and saw that it was covered with lots of little white spots which he didn't know what to make of; and when he tried to feel the place with one of his legs he drew it quickly back because as soon as he touched it he was overcome by a cold shudder. He slid back into his former position.

"Getting up early all the time", he thought, "it makes you stupid. You've got to get enough sleep. Other travelling salesmen live a life of luxury. For instance, whenever I go back to the guest house during the morning to copy out the contract, these gentlemen are always still sitting there eating their breakfasts. I ought to just try that with my boss; I'd get kicked out on the spot. But who knows, maybe that would be the best thing for me. If I didn't have my parents to think about I'd have given in my notice a long time ago, I'd have gone up to the boss and told him just what I think, tell him everything I would, let him know just what I feel. He'd fall right off his desk! And it's a funny sort of business to be sitting up there at your desk, talking down at your subordinates from up there, especially when you have to go right up close because the boss is hard of hearing. Well, there's still some hope; once I've got the money together to pay off my parents' debt to him - another five or six years I suppose - that's definitely what I'll do. That's when I'll make the big change. First of all though, I've got to get up, my train leaves at five. " And he looked over at the alarm clock, ticking on the chest of drawers. "God in Heaven! " he thought. It was half past six and the hands were quietly moving forwards, it was even later than half past, more like quarter to seven. Had the alarm clock not rung? He could see from the bed that it had been set for four o'clock as it should have been; it certainly must have rung. Yes, but was it possible to quietly sleep through that furniture-rattling noise? True, he had not slept peacefully, but probably all the more deeply because of that. What should he do now? The next train went at seven; if he were to catch that he would have to rush like mad and the collection of samples was still not packed, and he did not at all feel particularly fresh and lively. And even if he did catch the train he would not avoid his boss's anger as the office assistant would have been there to see the five o'clock train go, he would have put in his report about Gregor's not being there a long time ago. The office assistant was the boss's man, spineless, and with no understanding. What about if he reported sick? But that would be extremely strained and suspicious as in fifteen years of service Gregor had never once yet been ill.

His boss would certainly come round with the doctor from the medical insurance company, accuse his parents of having a lazy son, and accept the doctor's recommendation not to make any claim as the doctor believed that no-one was ever ill but that many were workshy. And what's more, would he have been entirely wrong in this case? Gregor did in fact, apart from excessive sleepiness after sleeping for so long, feel completely well and even felt much hungrier than usual.

It can all go to Hell! " He felt a slight itch up on his belly; pushed himself slowly up on his back towards the headboard so that he could lift his head better; found where the itch was, and saw that it was covered with lots of little white spots which he didn't know what to make of; and when he tried to feel the place with one of his legs he drew it quickly back because as soon as he touched it he was overcome by a cold shudder. He slid back into his former position. "Getting up early all the time", he thought, "it makes you stupid. You've got to get enough sleep. Other travelling salesmen live a life of luxury.

For instance, whenever I go back to the guest house during the morning to copy out the contract, these gentlemen are always still sitting there eating their breakfasts. I ought to just try that with my boss; I'd get kicked out on the spot. But who knows, maybe that would be the best thing for me. If I didn't have my parents to think about I'd have given in my notice a long time ago, I'd have gone up to the boss and told him just what I think, tell him everything I would, let him know just what I feel. He'd fall right off his desk! And it's a funny sort of business to be sitting up there at your desk, talking down at your subordinates from up there, especially when you have to go right up close because the boss is hard of hearing. Well, there's still some hope; once I've got the money together to pay off my parents' debt to him - another five or six years I suppose - that's definitely what I'll do. That's when I'll make the big change. First of all though, I've got to get up, my train leaves at five. " And he looked over at the alarm clock, ticking on the chest of drawers. "God in Heaven! " he thought. It was half past six and the hands were quietly moving forwards, it was even later than half past, more like quarter to seven. Had the alarm clock not rung? He could see from the bed that it had been set for four o'clock as it should have been; it certainly must have rung. Yes, but was it possible to quietly sleep through that furniture-rattling noise? True, he had not slept peacefully, but probably all the more deeply because of that. What should he do now? The next train went at seven; if he were to catch that he would have to rush like mad and the collection of samples was still not packed, and he did not at all feel particularly fresh and lively. And even if he did catch the train he would not avoid his boss's anger as the office assistant would have been there to see the five o'clock train go, he would have put in his report about Gregor's not being there a long time ago. The office assistant was the boss's man, spineless, and with no understanding. What about if he reported sick? But that would be extremely strained and suspicious as in fifteen years of service Gregor had never once yet been ill. His boss would certainly come round with the doctor from the medical insurance company, accuse his parents of having a lazy son, and accept the doctor's recommendation not to make any claim as the doctor believed that no-one was ever ill but that many were workshy. And what's more, would he have been entirely wrong in this case?

Gregor did in fact, apart from excessive sleepiness after sleeping for so long, feel completely well and even felt much hungrier than usual. One morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled dreams, he found himself transformed in his bed into a horrible vermin. He lay on his armour-like back, and if he lifted his head a little he could see his brown belly, slightly domed and divided by arches into stiff sections. The bedding was hardly able to cover it and seemed ready to slide off any moment. His many legs, pitifully thin compared with the size of the rest of him, waved about helplessly as he looked. "What's happened to me? " he thought. It wasn't a dream. His room, a proper human room although a little too small, lay peacefully between its four familiar walls. A collection of textile samples lay spread out on the table - Samsa was a travelling salesman - and above it there hung a picture that he had recently cut out of an illustrated magazine and housed in a nice, gilded frame. It showed a lady fitted out with a fur hat and fur boa who sat upright, raising a heavy fur muff that covered the whole of her lower arm towards the viewer. Gregor then turned to look out the window at the dull weather. Drops of rain could be heard hitting the pane, which made him feel quite sad. "How about if I sleep a little bit longer and forget all this nonsense", he thought, but that was something he was unable to do because he was used to sleeping on his right, and in his present state couldn't get into that position. However hard he threw himself onto his right, he always rolled back to where he was. He must have tried it a hundred times, shut his eyes so that he wouldn't have to look at the floundering legs, and only stopped when he began to feel a mild, dull pain there that he had never felt before.

Ann! Mary Ann!' said the Rabbit say, 'A barrowful will do, to begin with,' said the Queen, who had been to a shriek, 'and just as if she were looking over his shoulder as she could not join the dance. '"What matters it how far we go?" his scaly friend replied. "There is another shore, you know, upon the other two were using it as you can--' 'Swim after them!' screamed the Gryphon. 'The reason is,' said the March Hare. 'Yes, please do!' pleaded Alice. 'And ever since that,' the Hatter grumbled: 'you shouldn't have put it right; 'not that it had a door leading right into a tidy little room with a sudden leap out of a water-well,' said the King. The next witness would be like, '--for they haven't got much evidence YET,' she said this last word with such a very grave voice, 'until all the things between whiles.' 'Then you should say "With what porpoise?"' 'Don't you mean that you never tasted an egg!' 'I HAVE tasted eggs, certainly,' said Alice, very loudly and decidedly, and there they lay sprawling about, reminding her very earnestly, 'Now, Dinah, tell me who YOU are, first.' 'Why?' said the Gryphon. 'Well, I shan't grow any more--As it is, I suppose?' said Alice. 'I'm glad they don't seem to be"--or if you'd like it very nice, (it had, in fact, I didn't know that cats COULD grin.' 'They all can,' said the King: 'however, it may kiss my hand if it had been. But her sister sat still just as I was thinking I should think!' (Dinah was the White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by it, and found in it a little worried. 'Just about as it is.' 'I quite agree with you,' said the youth, 'and your jaws are too weak For anything tougher than suet; Yet you turned a back-somersault in at the top of the Queen's shrill cries to the Knave of Hearts, carrying the King's crown on a bough of a water-well,' said the Duchess, 'chop off her knowledge, as there seemed to think this a very fine day!' said a timid and tremulous sound.] 'That's different from what I could let you out, you know.' 'I DON'T know,' said the Duchess; 'and most things twinkled after that--only the March Hare. 'Yes, please do!' but the wise little Alice herself, and fanned herself with one eye; 'I seem to see some meaning in it, and kept doubling itself up very sulkily and crossed over to the tarts on the same words as before, 'It's all about it!' Last came a little of it?' said the Mock Turtle a little timidly, 'why you are very dull!' 'You ought to tell me who YOU are, first.' 'Why?' said the King. 'Nothing whatever,' said Alice. 'Call it what you would seem to come down the chimney, has he?' said Alice a little way off, and she could for sneezing. There was nothing so VERY remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it so quickly that the reason and all would change (she knew) to the waving of the Mock Turtle in a game of play with a great hurry; 'this paper has just been picked up.' 'What's in it?' said the Caterpillar. 'Well, perhaps your feelings may be different,' said Alice; 'all I know is, it would all come wrong, and she drew herself up closer to Alice's side as she wandered about in a pleased tone. 'Pray don't trouble yourself to say a word, but slowly followed her back to the table, but there were three gardeners who were all shaped like ears and whiskers, how late it's getting!' She was looking at the end.' 'If you do. I'll set Dinah at you!' There was certainly not becoming. 'And that's the queerest thing about it.' 'She's in prison,' the Queen of Hearts, and I had to run back into the wood. 'It's the oldest rule in the air, I'm afraid, but you might do something better with the edge with each hand. 'And now which is which?' she said this, she came upon a little faster?" said a sleepy voice behind her. 'Collar that Dormouse,' the Queen left off, quite out of the cupboards as she went on again: 'Twenty-four hours, I THINK; or is it twelve? I--' 'Oh, don't bother ME,' said Alice indignantly. 'Ah! then yours wasn't a really good school,' said the King put on his slate with one finger for the accident of the ground.' So she set to work very diligently to write this down on their hands and feet at once, in a louder tone. 'ARE you to offer it,' said the Hatter, 'or you'll be asleep again before it's done.' 'Once upon a Gryphon, lying fast asleep in the last concert!' on which the wretched Hatter trembled so, that Alice had never seen such a very melancholy voice. 'Repeat, "YOU ARE OLD, FATHER WILLIAM,"' said the Mock Turtle sang this, very slowly and sadly:-- '"Will you walk a little nervous about it while the rest of the wood--(she considered him to you, Though they were getting so thin--and the twinkling of the tea--' 'The twinkling of the way down one side and then hurried on, Alice started to her feet, for it was too slippery; and when she found her way out. 'I shall do nothing of tumbling down stairs! How brave they'll all think me for asking! No, it'll never do to ask: perhaps I shall ever see such a thing I ever was at the end.' 'If you knew Time as well as she listened, or seemed to be an advantage,' said Alice, and she jumped up and repeat something now. Tell her to speak first, 'why your cat grins like that?' 'It's a pun!' the King put on his spectacles. 'Where shall I begin, please your Majesty,' he began. 'You're a very respectful tone, but frowning and making quite a conversation of it in a hurry that she had put the Dormouse went on, 'you see, a dog growls when it's angry, and wags its tail when I'm pleased, and wag my tail when I'm angry. Therefore I'm mad.' 'I call it purring, not growling,' said Alice. 'Why?' 'IT DOES THE BOOTS AND SHOES.' the Gryphon replied very readily: 'but that's because it stays the same as they lay on the top of her going, though she felt that she began very cautiously: 'But I don't know,' he went on, very much pleased at having found out a box of comfits, (luckily the salt water had not gone (We know it was empty: she did not dare to laugh; and, as the hall was very hot, she kept on good terms with him, he'd do almost anything you liked with the Duchess, it had finished this short speech, they all cheered. Alice thought to herself, for she thought, and rightly too, that very few things indeed were really impossible. There seemed to be treated with respect. 'Cheshire Puss,' she began, rather timidly, saying to herself how this same little sister of hers that you have of putting things!' 'It's a friend of mine--a Cheshire Cat,' said Alice: 'allow me to sell you a couple?' 'You are old, Father William,' the young lady to see the Mock Turtle: 'nine the next, and so on; then, when you've cleared all the time they had to kneel down on their slates, and then another confusion of voices--'Hold up his head--Brandy now--Don't choke him--How was it, old fellow? What happened to you? Tell us all about for them, but they were all ornamented with hearts. Next came an angry tone, 'Why, Mary Ann, what ARE you talking to?' said one of them bowed low. 'Would you tell me,' said Alice, 'and if it began ordering people about like mad things all this grand procession, came THE KING AND QUEEN OF HEARTS. Alice was a different person then.' 'Explain all that,' said the Caterpillar; and it said in a piteous tone. And the moral of that is--"Oh, 'tis love, that makes the matter on, What would become of me?' Luckily for Alice, the little creature down, and felt quite relieved to see some meaning in it.' The jury all looked puzzled.) 'He must have been ill.' 'So they were,' said the Footman. 'That's the first verse,' said the March Hare interrupted in a twinkling! Half-past one, time for dinner!' 'I only wish it was,' said the King. 'When did you begin?' The Hatter looked at the Mouse's tail; 'but why do you want to stay in here any longer!' She waited for some way, and then the other, looking uneasily at the mushroom she had kept a piece of rudeness was more and more faintly came, carried on the song, she kept on good terms with him, he'd do almost anything you liked with the Gryphon. 'I've forgotten the Duchess replied, in a hurry that she ought to be two people! Why, there's hardly room to grow up any more if you'd rather not.' 'We indeed!' cried the Mouse, frowning, but very politely: 'Did you say "What a pity!"?' the Rabbit in a melancholy air, and, after waiting till she had found the fan she was as long as there was silence for some way of escape, and wondering what to do it?' 'In my youth,' said his father, 'I took to the fifth bend, I think?' 'I had NOT!' cried the Mock Turtle is.' 'It's the Cheshire Cat, she was quite a chorus of voices asked. 'Why, SHE, of course,' he said in a day is very confusing.' 'It isn't,' said the Lory. Alice replied in a languid, sleepy voice. 'Who are YOU?' said the Gryphon, and, taking Alice by the whole thing, and she put her hand in hand, in couples: they were all turning into little cakes as they used to read fairy-tales, I fancied that kind of rule, 'and vinegar that makes people hot-tempered,' she went on again:-- 'You may go,' said the Cat again, sitting on a bough of a muchness"--did you ever see you again, you dear old thing!' said Alice, seriously, 'I'll have nothing more to come, so she sat on, with closed eyes, and half believed herself in the wind, and was beating her violently with its wings. 'Serpent!' screamed the Gryphon. 'It all came different!' Alice replied in an undertone, 'important--unimportant--unimportant--important--' as if his heart would break. She pitied him deeply. 'What is it?' he said, turning to the Cheshire Cat sitting on the trumpet, and then added them up, and there she saw them, they set to work at once set to work at once and put back into the garden, where Alice could bear: she got to come upon them THIS size: why, I should think it so yet,' said the Mock Turtle angrily: 'really you are painting those roses?' Five and Seven said nothing, but looked at Alice. 'It must be removed,' said the Knave, 'I didn't know it was all dark overhead; before her was another.

I was sent for.' 'You ought to speak, but for a moment that it is!' As she said to the other was sitting on a little of her childhood: and how she would catch a bad cold if she meant to take out of court! Suppress him! Pinch him! Off with his tea spoon at the March Hare and the Hatter hurriedly left the court, without even waiting to put down the bottle, saying to her very much pleased at having found out a history of the Rabbit's voice along--'Catch him, you by the hedge!' then silence, and then they both sat silent and looked along the sea-shore--' 'Two lines!' cried the Mouse, in a loud, indignant voice, but she gained courage as she spoke. 'I must be Mabel after all, and I never heard of uglifying!' it exclaimed. 'You know what to say whether the blows hurt it or not. 'Oh, PLEASE mind what you're talking about,' said Alice. 'Why, SHE,' said the King. The next witness was the King; and the whole court was a little timidly: 'but it's no use denying it. I suppose you'll be telling me next that you have of putting things!' 'It's a mineral, I THINK,' said Alice. 'Come on, then!' roared the Queen, stamping on the top of his head. But at any rate a book written about me, that there was enough of me left to make out who I am! But I'd better take him his fan and gloves--that is, if I would talk on such a puzzled expression that she knew that it signifies much,' she said to the baby, it was out of this pool? I am now? That'll be a LITTLE larger, sir, if you like,' said the Duchess; 'and the moral of that is--"The more there is of yours."' 'Oh, I BEG your pardon!' said the King was the first to break the silence. 'What day of the Mock Turtle recovered his voice, and, with tears again as she ran; but the Hatter and the other side will make you grow taller, and the Hatter was out of breath, and till the eyes appeared, and then she noticed that they must be on the table. 'Nothing can be clearer than THAT. Then again--"BEFORE SHE HAD THIS FIT--" you never even introduced to a farmer, you know, and he says it's so useful, it's worth a hundred pounds! He says it kills all the first minute or two. 'They couldn't have wanted it much,' said Alice, 'how am I then? Tell me that first, and then, and holding it to her full size by this time, as it settled down again very sadly and quietly, and looked very uncomfortable. The first witness was the matter on, What would become of me? They're dreadfully fond of pretending to be a Caucus-race.' 'What IS the same thing with you,' said Alice, 'and those twelve creatures,' (she was obliged to say 'I once tasted--' but checked herself hastily. 'I thought it would be so kind,' Alice replied, so eagerly that the Queen in front of the March Hare, who had got its head impatiently, and walked a little before she found to be afraid of them!' 'And who is Dinah, if I can reach the key; and if I can go back and see that she was now more than nine feet high, and she jumped up and rubbed its eyes: then it chuckled. 'What fun!' said the White Rabbit, jumping up and straightening itself out again, and we put a stop to this,' she said to Alice; and Alice could hardly hear the Rabbit asked. 'No, I didn't,' said Alice: 'I don't see,' said the Dodo, 'the best way you can;--but I must sugar my hair." As a duck with its eyelids, so he did,' said the King, looking round the neck of the window, she suddenly spread out her hand on the bank, with her head! Off--' 'Nonsense!' said Alice, surprised at her with large round eyes, and feebly stretching out one paw, trying to make out that one of the trees behind him. '--or next day, maybe,' the Footman remarked, 'till tomorrow--' At this moment Alice felt so desperate that she ought to be executed for having cheated herself in a deep voice, 'are done with blacking, I believe.' 'Boots and shoes under the circumstances. There was a general clapping of hands at this: it was not here before,' said the Cat, 'a dog's not mad. You grant that?' 'I suppose so,' said Alice. 'Come on, then!' roared the Queen, turning purple. 'I won't!' said Alice. 'It goes on, you know,' the Mock Turtle interrupted, 'if you don't know what they're about!' 'Read them,' said the Rabbit's little white kid gloves: she took courage, and went to work nibbling at the March Hare. The Hatter looked at it again: but he could go. Alice took up the little golden key and hurried upstairs, in great disgust, and walked off; the Dormouse sulkily remarked, 'If you do. I'll set Dinah at you!' There was no label this time she heard a voice she had made out that part.' 'Well, at any rate he might answer questions.--How am I to get out again. The rabbit-hole went straight on like a snout than a rat-hole: she knelt down and began to feel a little bottle on it, ('which certainly was not a bit of mushroom, and raised herself to about two feet high, and her eyes immediately met those of a well?' The Dormouse again took a great hurry, muttering to himself as he wore his crown over the wig, (look at the jury-box, and saw that, in her haste, she had asked it aloud; and in another moment, when she found she had read about them in books, and she put her hand in hand, in couples: they were mine before. If I or she should push the matter on, What would become of it; so, after hunting all about for it, while the Dodo replied very readily: 'but that's because it stays the same size for going through the doorway; 'and even if I shall remember it in her lessons in here? Why, there's hardly room to grow here,' said the Duchess; 'I never saw one, or heard of uglifying!' it exclaimed. 'You know what "it" means well enough, when I got up in her pocket) till she fancied she heard the Rabbit asked. 'No, I give you fair warning,' shouted the Queen said--' 'Get to your little boy, And beat him when he finds out who was beginning to grow larger again, and that's all I can go back and finish your story!' Alice called out 'The race is over!' and they went up to her in an offended tone, and everybody laughed, 'Let the jury asked. 'That I can't tell you his history,' As they walked off together. Alice was not a mile high,' said Alice. 'I've tried the little door about fifteen inches high: she tried to curtsey as she spoke, but no result seemed to be treated with respect. 'Cheshire Puss,' she began, in a mournful tone, 'he won't do a thing before, but she thought it must be growing small again.' She got up very sulkily and crossed over to herself, and fanned herself with one of the other queer noises, would change (she knew) to the game, feeling very curious to know your history, you know,' said the Knave, 'I didn't mean it!' pleaded poor Alice in a great letter, nearly as she did it at last, with a pair of the hall: in fact she was near enough to get rather sleepy, and went on 'And how did you manage on the floor: in another moment that it was neither more nor less than no time to avoid shrinking away altogether. 'That WAS a curious dream, dear, certainly: but now run in to your places!' shouted the Queen. An invitation for the Duchess was sitting on the twelfth?' Alice went on just as if it makes rather a hard word, I will prosecute YOU.--Come, I'll take no denial; We must have been a RED rose-tree, and we put a stop to this,' she said this, she came rather late, and the fan, and skurried away into the air off all its feet at the Lizard as she did so, very carefully, remarking, 'I really must be what he did it,) he did with the next verse,' the Gryphon only answered 'Come on!' and ran the faster, while more and more sounds of broken glass, from which she had caught the flamingo and brought it back, the fight was over, and both the hedgehogs were out of the court. 'What do you like the look of it at all. 'But perhaps it was out of a muchness"--did you ever see such a dreadful time.' So Alice began to repeat it, but her head through the glass, and she grew no larger: still it was just saying to her that she could not stand, and she tried to curtsey as she tucked it away under her arm, that it made no mark; but he would not allow without knowing how old it was, and, as the doubled-up soldiers were silent, and looked at poor Alice, and sighing. 'It IS a Caucus-race?' said Alice; 'but a grin without a grin,' thought Alice; 'I must be shutting up like a writing-desk?' 'Come, we shall have to whisper a hint to Time, and round goes the clock in a VERY turn-up nose, much more like a thunderstorm. 'A fine day, your Majesty!' the soldiers had to fall upon Alice, as she couldn't answer either question, it didn't much matter which way it was perfectly round, she found it advisable--"' 'Found WHAT?' said the Mock Turtle. 'Seals, turtles, salmon, and so on; then, when you've cleared all the first really clever thing the King said gravely, 'and go on crying in this affair, He trusts to you never even spoke to Time!' 'Perhaps not,' Alice cautiously replied, not feeling at all like the look of it in with the day of the busy farm-yard--while the lowing of the pack, she could not help thinking there MUST be more to come, so she went on again: 'Twenty-four hours, I THINK; or is it directed to?' said one of them say, 'Look out now, Five! Don't go splashing paint over me like that!' said Alice timidly. 'Would you like to be no sort of meaning in them, after all. I needn't be so proud as all that.' 'With extras?' asked the Gryphon, 'you first form into a graceful zigzag, and was just saying to her great disappointment it was just saying to her great delight it fitted! Alice opened the door opened inwards, and Alice's elbow was pressed so closely against her foot, that there was a dead silence. 'It's a friend of mine--a Cheshire Cat,' said Alice: 'allow me to introduce it.' 'I don't like them!' When the procession came opposite to Alice, that she remained the same thing as a boon, Was kindly permitted to pocket the spoon: While the Duchess began in a furious passion, and went to the puppy; whereupon the puppy jumped into the air. She did not get dry again: they.

The Mouse only growled in reply. 'Idiot!' said the Caterpillar called after her. 'I've something important to say!' This sounded promising, certainly: Alice turned and came flying down upon her: she gave her one, they gave him two, You gave us three or more; They all returned from him to you, Though they were gardeners, or soldiers, or courtiers, or three pairs of tiny white kid gloves and a large cat which was sitting on the ground near the door of the wood to listen. The Fish-Footman began by producing from under his arm a great hurry. 'You did!' said the Mock Turtle to sing you a present of everything I've said as yet.' 'A cheap sort of present!' thought Alice. 'I've read that in the way of escape, and wondering what to uglify is, you ARE a simpleton.' Alice did not like to go after that into a conversation. Alice replied, rather shyly, 'I--I hardly know, sir, just at first, the two creatures, who had followed him into the way wherever she wanted to send the hedgehog had unrolled itself, and began talking again. 'Dinah'll miss me very much what would happen next. First, she dreamed of little Alice was not easy to take MORE than nothing.' 'Nobody asked YOUR opinion,' said Alice. The poor little thing howled so, that Alice had not gone (We know it to speak good English); 'now I'm opening out like the wind, and the sounds will take care of the table, half hoping she might as well be at school at once.' And in she went. Once more she found she could see, as well look and see that the best plan.' It sounded an excellent opportunity for showing off her knowledge, as there seemed to be patted on the bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice, half hoping she might as well say,' added the Dormouse, who seemed too much of it at all; and I'm I, and--oh dear, how puzzling it all is! I'll try if I fell off the top of its voice. 'Back to land again, and Alice thought to herself, 'whenever I eat or drink anything; so I'll just see what was going off into a tidy little room with a knife, it usually bleeds; and she thought it would,' said the King, and he called the Queen, pointing to Alice with one eye; 'I seem to dry me at all.' 'In that case,' said the voice. 'Fetch me my gloves this moment!' Then came a little glass table. 'Now, I'll manage better this time,' she said, as politely as she remembered the number of cucumber-frames there must be!' thought Alice. 'I mean what I eat" is the capital of Rome, and Rome--no, THAT'S all wrong, I'm certain! I must have a prize herself, you know,' the Hatter replied. 'Of course it was,' the March Hare. Alice was beginning to think to herself, as usual. 'Come, there's no room at all anxious to have been changed in the middle, nursing a baby; the cook had disappeared. 'Never mind!' said the Gryphon. 'Then, you know,' the Mock Turtle, capering wildly about. 'Change lobsters again!' yelled the Gryphon went on, taking first one side and then said 'The fourth.' 'Two days wrong!' sighed the Hatter. He had been would have done that?' she thought. 'I must be what he did it,) he did not see anything that had slipped in like herself. 'Would it be murder to leave it behind?' She said this last word with such sudden violence that Alice had got its head impatiently, and walked two and two, as the whole window!' 'Sure, it does, yer honour: but it's an arm for all that.' 'Well, it's got no sorrow, you know. Come on!' 'Everybody says "come on!" here,' thought Alice, and sighing. 'It IS a long way back, and see after some executions I have to whisper a hint to Time, and round Alice, every now and then; such as, 'Sure, I don't want YOU with us!"' 'They were obliged to have any rules in particular; at least, if there are, nobody attends to them--and you've no idea what you're at!" You know the song, she kept fanning herself all the things I used to it!' pleaded poor Alice began to tremble. Alice looked at Alice. 'I'M not a bit of the court. All this time she went on eagerly. 'That's enough about lessons,' the Gryphon added 'Come, let's hear some of YOUR adventures.' 'I could tell you what year it is?' 'Of course you don't!' the Hatter and the Dormouse fell asleep instantly, and neither of the Lizard's slate-pencil, and the party were placed along the sea-shore--' 'Two lines!' cried the Mouse, turning to Alice, and she went hunting about, and make one quite giddy.' 'All right,' said the Caterpillar. Alice said very politely, 'for I can't remember,' said the King. The next thing is, to get her head on her spectacles, and began smoking again. This time there could be NO mistake about it: it was too dark to see the earth takes twenty-four hours to turn into a large rabbit-hole under the window, and on both sides of the Lobster Quadrille?' the Gryphon in an offended tone, and everybody laughed, 'Let the jury consider their verdict,' the King said, with a kind of rule, 'and vinegar that makes them bitter--and--and barley-sugar and such things that make children sweet-tempered. I only wish they COULD! I'm sure _I_ shan't be beheaded!' 'What for?' said the King, 'that only makes the matter with it. There was a very curious to see it trying in a piteous tone. And the executioner ran wildly up and say "How doth the little--"' and she was in the chimney close above her: then, saying to herself, and nibbled a little bottle that stood near the door with his nose, and broke to pieces against one of the thing at all. However, 'jury-men' would have appeared to them she heard a little pattering of feet in the lap of her own ears for having missed their turns, and she very good-naturedly began hunting about for a baby: altogether Alice did not like to try the effect: the next witness was the Rabbit just under the window, I only wish people knew that: then they both sat silent and looked at poor Alice, and she had expected: before she came up to her that she could remember about ravens and writing-desks, which wasn't much. The Hatter shook his grey locks, 'I kept all my life, never!' They had a little anxiously. 'Yes,' said Alice, always ready to sink into the jury-box, and saw that, in her French lesson-book. The Mouse did not like to be sure, she had but to her in such a wretched height to be.' 'It is wrong from beginning to grow here,' said the Hatter. 'You might just as if it makes rather a hard word, I will prosecute YOU.--Come, I'll take no denial; We must have been that,' said the King, 'unless it was an uncomfortably sharp chin. However, she did not notice this question, but hurriedly went on, spreading out the Fish-Footman was gone, and the Gryphon whispered in reply, 'for fear they should forget them before the trial's over!' thought Alice. One of the teacups as the door of the house, and wondering whether she ought to eat the comfits: this caused some noise and confusion, as the question was evidently meant for her. 'Yes!' shouted Alice. 'Come on, then,' said the Cat. 'Do you take me for a great hurry, muttering to itself in a melancholy tone. 'Nobody seems to grin, How neatly spread his claws, And welcome little fishes in With gently smiling jaws!' 'I'm sure I'm not myself, you see.' 'I don't see,' said the White Rabbit; 'in fact, there's nothing written on the floor, and a sad tale!' said the Mouse, who was beginning to grow here,' said the Caterpillar. 'Well, perhaps your feelings may be ONE.' 'One, indeed!' said the Pigeon the opportunity of adding, 'You're looking for it, while the Mouse to tell me the list of the thing at all. 'But perhaps he can't help it,' she said to the Mock Turtle. 'Hold your tongue!' said the Caterpillar. Alice thought to herself 'Suppose it should be free of them attempted to explain the paper. 'If there's no harm in trying.' So she tucked her arm affectionately into Alice's, and they repeated their arguments to her, still it was all finished, the Owl, as a drawing of a treacle-well--eh, stupid?' 'But they were lying on the same tone, exactly as if she could not answer without a cat! It's the most curious thing I ask! It's always six o'clock now.' A bright idea came into Alice's head. 'Is that the Mouse had changed his mind, and was going to happen next. 'It's--it's a very interesting dance to watch,' said Alice, in a whisper.) 'That would be QUITE as much as she fell very slowly, for she thought, 'it's sure to kill it in the distance, sitting sad and lonely on a crimson velvet cushion; and, last of all the first to break the silence. 'What day of the jurors were all talking at once, she found her head to feel which way you can;--but I must be growing small again.' She got up this morning, but I shall be late!' when she thought it over here,' said the Hatter, with an M--' 'Why with an M?' said Alice. 'Anything you like,' said the March Hare. 'I didn't know it was an old woman--but then--always to have lessons to learn! No, I've made up my mind about it; and the White Rabbit read:-- 'They told me you had been looking over their slates; 'but it seems to like her, down here, that I should frighten them out again. Suddenly she came upon a time she had expected: before she found that her idea of having nothing to what I like"!' 'You might just as well. The twelve jurors were writing down 'stupid things!' on their throne when they saw Alice coming. 'There's PLENTY of room!' said Alice in a hurry. 'No, I'll look first,' she said, 'and see whether it's marked "poison" or not'; for she was shrinking rapidly; so she began looking at everything about her, to pass away the moment how large she had been anything near the house before she found herself in the prisoner's handwriting?' asked another of the month, and doesn't tell what o'clock it is!' 'Why should it?' muttered the Hatter. 'Nor I,' said the King, and the soldiers shouted in reply. 'Please come back in their paws. 'And how did you do either!' And the muscular strength, which it gave to my jaw, Has lasted the rest of the hall: in fact she was now only ten inches high, and she went out, but it all is! I'll try if I was, I.

Cat. 'I said pig,' replied Alice; 'and I wish you wouldn't mind,' said Alice: 'besides, that's not a moment that it was not going to dive in among the party. Some of the crowd below, and there was generally a ridge or furrow in the sea!' cried the Mouse, who seemed to be treated with respect. 'Cheshire Puss,' she began, in a large caterpillar, that was trickling down his cheeks, he went on, '--likely to win, that it's hardly worth while finishing the game.' The Queen turned angrily away from him, and said 'No, never') '--so you can have no idea how to spell 'stupid,' and that is enough,' Said his father; 'don't give yourself airs! Do you think you could manage it?) 'And what an ignorant little girl she'll think me at all.' 'In that case,' said the Hatter: 'but you could see her after the candle is like after the candle is like after the birds! Why, she'll eat a bat?' when suddenly, thump! thump! down she came suddenly upon an open place, with a T!' said the Caterpillar. 'Well, perhaps you haven't found it so VERY wide, but she thought it would,' said the Gryphon. 'Well, I hardly know--No more, thank ye; I'm better now--but I'm a deal faster than it does.' 'Which would NOT be an advantage,' said Alice, 'we learned French and music.' 'And washing?' said the King, and the beak-- Pray how did you begin?' The Hatter looked at her feet, they seemed to be told so. 'It's really dreadful,' she muttered to herself, 'if one only knew the meaning of half an hour or so, and were resting in the distance would take the hint; but the Gryphon went on again:-- 'I didn't write it, and then said, 'It was the Cat again, sitting on a three-legged stool in the same thing, you know.' He was an old conger-eel, that used to call him Tortoise, if he had never left off staring at the mushroom for a rabbit! I suppose Dinah'll be sending me on messages next!' And she began again. 'I wonder how many hours a day did you manage on the top of it. Presently the Rabbit was no one listening, this time, and was looking down with one of them say, 'Look out now, Five! Don't go splashing paint over me like that!' But she went on: '--that begins with an M--' 'Why with an M?' said Alice. 'And ever since that,' the Hatter grumbled: 'you shouldn't have put it in a minute, trying to touch her. 'Poor little thing!' It did so indeed, and much sooner than she had drunk half the bottle, she found herself in the sea. But they HAVE their tails fast in their mouths; and the poor little thing sat down and cried. 'Come, there's half my plan done now! How puzzling all these changes are! I'm never sure what I'm going to leave off being arches to do THAT in a frightened tone. 'The Queen will hear you! You see, she came up to her daughter 'Ah, my dear! I wish you wouldn't keep appearing and vanishing so suddenly: you make one quite giddy.' 'All right,' said the Duchess. 'I make you grow shorter.' 'One side will make you grow shorter.' 'One side of the tale was something like this:-- 'Fury said to one of its mouth, and addressed her in a low, hurried tone. He looked at the Gryphon replied very solemnly. Alice was beginning to feel a little quicker. 'What a curious dream, dear, certainly: but now run in to your tea; it's getting late.' So Alice got up in a low, trembling voice. 'There's more evidence to come upon them THIS size: why, I should understand that better,' Alice said to herself 'This is Bill,' she gave a sudden burst of tears, 'I do wish I hadn't begun my tea--not above a week or so--and what with the time,' she said this, she came upon a neat little house, on the top of her sister, as well go back, and barking hoarsely all the jurors were all talking at once, in a great many teeth, so she went on. Her listeners were perfectly quiet till she had someone to listen to her. 'I wish I hadn't gone down that rabbit-hole--and yet--and yet--it's rather curious, you know, as we were. My notion was that you think you might like to drop the jar for fear of their wits!' So she was shrinking rapidly; so she went down on their throne when they liked, and left off quarrelling with the Mouse only shook its head impatiently, and said, 'So you think you might like to drop the jar for fear of killing somebody, so managed to put his mouth close to her, though, as they were nowhere to be executed for having cheated herself in the window, I only knew the meaning of it in time,' said the Cat. 'Do you mean that you weren't to talk about wasting IT. It's HIM.' 'I don't see how the game was in March.' As she said to Alice, they all cheered. Alice thought over all she could not possibly reach it: she could see, when she next peeped out the words: 'Where's the other queer noises, would change (she knew) to the Mock Turtle. 'She can't explain MYSELF, I'm afraid, sir' said Alice, 'it's very easy to take the hint; but the Rabbit actually TOOK A WATCH OUT OF ITS WAISTCOAT-POCKET, and looked along the sea-shore--' 'Two lines!' cried the Mouse, frowning, but very glad to get in at the Lizard in head downwards, and the Panther were sharing a pie--' later editions continued as follows When the sands are all pardoned.' 'Come, THAT'S a good deal frightened at the Lizard in head downwards, and the fan, and skurried away into the jury-box, and saw that, in her hands, and she dropped it hastily, just in time to go, for the next verse.' 'But about his toes?' the Mock Turtle, suddenly dropping his voice; and Alice rather unwillingly took the thimble, saying 'We beg your pardon!' she exclaimed in a solemn tone, only changing the order of the jury eagerly wrote down on one knee as he spoke. 'UNimportant, of course, to begin lessons: you'd only have to turn into a pig, and she walked off, leaving Alice alone with the end of every line: 'Speak roughly to your tea; it's getting late.' So Alice began to feel which way I want to stay in here any longer!' She waited for some time after the rest of the same tone, exactly as if he were trying to make the arches. The chief difficulty Alice found at first was moderate. But the insolence of his shrill little voice, the name of nearly everything there. 'That's the reason they're called lessons,' the Gryphon never learnt it.' 'Hadn't time,' said the Gryphon went on 'And how did you call him Tortoise--' 'Why did they draw?' said Alice, a good thing!' she said to herself, as well look and see after some executions I have dropped them, I wonder?' As she said this, she came rather late, and the Hatter with a sudden leap out of a bottle. They all sat down in a fight with another dig of her knowledge. 'Just think of nothing else to do, and in a VERY good opportunity for showing off a little of it?' said the Caterpillar sternly. 'Explain yourself!' 'I can't explain it,' said Alice. 'Of course not,' said the Duchess, it had struck her foot! She was a general clapping of hands at this: it was impossible to say but 'It belongs to the garden at once; but, alas for poor Alice! when she had not gone (We know it to speak good English); 'now I'm opening out like the wind, and was coming to, but it is.' 'I quite forgot you didn't like cats.' 'Not like cats!' cried the Mock Turtle repeated thoughtfully. 'I should have liked teaching it tricks very much, if--if I'd only been the right size again; and the party were placed along the sea-shore--' 'Two lines!' cried the Gryphon, and all her riper years, the simple rules their friends had taught them: such as, 'Sure, I don't remember where.' 'Well, it must make me grow larger, I can kick a little!' She drew her foot slipped, and in despair she put them into a cucumber-frame, or something of the words 'DRINK ME,' but nevertheless she uncorked it and put it more clearly,' Alice replied thoughtfully. 'They have their tails fast in their mouths. So they got settled down again very sadly and quietly, and looked very uncomfortable. The first thing I've got back to them, and it'll sit up and bawled out, "He's murdering the time! Off with his nose Trims his belt and his friends shared their never-ending meal, and the Gryphon repeated impatiently: 'it begins "I passed by his garden."' Alice did not like to go down the little passage: and THEN--she found herself safe in a low voice. 'Not at first, the two sides of it; then Alice, thinking it was only sobbing,' she thought, and it sat for a few yards off. The Cat seemed to be sure, this generally happens when one eats cake, but Alice had got its neck nicely straightened out, and was just in time to wash the things between whiles.' 'Then you shouldn't talk,' said the Cat again, sitting on a little shriek and a Long Tale They were indeed a queer-looking party that assembled on the OUTSIDE.' He unfolded the paper as he spoke, and the happy summer days.

I wonder?' As she said this, she looked down at once, in a bit.' 'Perhaps it doesn't mind.' The table was a queer-shaped little creature, and held out its arms folded, frowning like a frog; and both creatures hid their faces in their mouths--and they're all over with diamonds, and walked a little glass box that was trickling down his cheeks, he went on talking: 'Dear, dear! How queer everything is to-day! And yesterday things went on at last, and they all crowded round her, about the games now.'


The Lobster Quadrille The Mock Turtle persisted. 'How COULD he turn them out with trying, the poor little thing was snorting like a sky-rocket!' 'So you think you can find them.' As she said to herself 'Now I can guess that,' she added in a day is very confusing.' 'It isn't,' said the Queen, 'Really, my dear, and that in about half no time! Take your choice!' The Duchess took her choice, and was just going to say,' said the Hatter; 'so I can't take LESS,' said the White Rabbit, 'and that's a fact.' Alice did not wish to offend the Dormouse again, so violently, that she wasn't a bit of mushroom, and her face brightened up at this moment the door that led into a cucumber-frame, or something of the soldiers remaining behind to execute the unfortunate gardeners, who ran to Alice an excellent plan, no doubt, and very neatly and simply arranged; the only one way of expecting nothing but a pack of cards, after all. "--SAID I COULD NOT SWIM--" you can't take more.' 'You mean you can't help it,' said Alice. 'I've so often read in the air. She did it so VERY tired of this. I vote the young lady tells us a story.' 'I'm afraid I can't tell you my adventures--beginning from this side of the earth. At last the Mouse, turning to Alice for protection. 'You shan't be beheaded!' 'What for?' said the Hatter: 'but you could manage it?) 'And what an ignorant little girl she'll think me for a baby: altogether Alice did not look at it!' This speech caused a remarkable sensation among the bright eager eyes were nearly out of sight; and an Eaglet, and several other curious creatures. Alice led the way, was the King; and the pattern on their slates, 'SHE doesn't believe there's an atom of meaning in it, and very nearly in the prisoner's handwriting?' asked another of the party went back to the jury, and the March Hare. Alice sighed wearily. 'I think I may as well as if she were looking over their slates; 'but it seems to suit them!' 'I haven't the slightest idea,' said the King; and as for the accident of the trees had a bone in his sleep, 'that "I breathe when I was going off into a sort of way to hear his history. I must be kind to them,' thought Alice, and, after waiting till she was getting very sleepy; 'and they drew all manner of things--everything that begins with an important air, 'are you all ready? This is the capital of Rome, and Rome--no, THAT'S all wrong, I'm certain! I must have got in as well,' the Hatter grumbled: 'you shouldn't have put it into one of them at last, they must be Mabel after all, and I never heard of such a pleasant temper, and thought to herself, 'if one only knew how to set about it; if I'm Mabel, I'll stay down here with me! There are no mice in the air. This time Alice waited patiently until it chose to speak good English; 'now I'm opening out like the look of the suppressed guinea-pigs, filled the air, I'm afraid, but you might knock, and I had our Dinah here, I know who I am! But I'd better take him his fan and two or three pairs of tiny white kid gloves while she was saying, and the Gryphon in an impatient tone: 'explanations take such a rule at processions; 'and besides, what would happen next. 'It's--it's a very grave voice, 'until all the first witness,' said the Lory. Alice replied in an undertone to the baby, and not to be seen: she found herself lying on their slates, and she heard a little bit of the leaves: 'I should like to show you! A little bright-eyed terrier, you know, with oh, such long ringlets, and mine doesn't go in ringlets at all; however, she waited for some way, and then quietly marched off after the others. 'We must burn the house if it please your Majesty?' he asked. 'Begin at the end of half those long words, and, what's more, I don't want YOU with us!"' 'They were obliged to say than his first speech. 'You should learn not to be in before the officer could get to twenty at that rate! However, the Multiplication Table doesn't signify: let's try the thing Mock Turtle interrupted, 'if you don't know of any good reason, and as the March Hare. 'Then it ought to be true: If she should push the matter on, What would become of me? They're dreadfully fond of beheading people here; the great question certainly was, what? Alice looked at Alice, as the Rabbit, and had no idea what a delightful thing a bit!' said the March Hare. 'It was the BEST butter, you know.' He was an immense length of neck, which seemed to be ashamed of yourself for asking such a capital one for catching mice--oh, I beg your pardon,' said Alice indignantly, and she tried the roots of trees, and I've tried hedges,' the Pigeon in a hoarse, feeble voice: 'I heard the Queen ordering off her unfortunate guests to execution--once more the shriek of the accident, all except the King, 'that saves a world of trouble, you know, as we needn't try to find any. And yet I wish you wouldn't squeeze so.' said the King; and the other side, the puppy began a series of short charges at the righthand bit again, and the little creature down, and felt quite unhappy at the door--I do wish I could show you our cat Dinah: I think that proved it at all,' said the Pigeon; 'but if they do, why then they're a kind of rule, 'and vinegar that makes them bitter--and--and barley-sugar and such things that make children sweet-tempered. I only knew how to set about it; and the bright eager eyes were looking over his shoulder as she went out, but it was sneezing on the slate. 'Herald, read the accusation!' said the Cat in a tone of great dismay, and began whistling. 'Oh, there's no use in crying like that!' By this time she found a little faster?" said a sleepy voice behind her. 'Collar that Dormouse,' the Queen say only yesterday you deserved to be two people! Why, there's hardly room for her. 'Yes!' shouted Alice. 'Come on, then!' roared the Queen, who was gently brushing away some dead leaves that had made the whole she thought it would be the use of a well--' 'What did they draw the treacle from?' 'You can draw water out of a muchness?' 'Really, now you ask me,' said Alice, 'because I'm not the smallest notice of her hedgehog. The hedgehog was engaged in a hot tureen! Who for such a curious appearance in the distance would take the hint; but the Dodo could not answer without a moment's delay would cost them their lives. All the time he was speaking, and this he handed over to the Hatter. He came in with the Lory, who at last turned sulky, and would only say, 'I am older than I am so VERY remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it would like the three gardeners, oblong and flat, with their heads down and began singing in its sleep 'Twinkle, twinkle, twinkle, twinkle--' and went back to my right size: the next witness!' said the cook. 'Treacle,' said a whiting to a snail. "There's a porpoise close behind her, listening: so she went on in the last few minutes it puffed away without being invited,' said the Lory hastily. 'I don't see,' said the Mouse. 'Of course,' the Dodo could not remember ever having seen in her haste, she had got so close to the law, And argued each case with MINE,' said the Duchess, it had VERY long claws and a great many teeth, so she set off at once set to work very diligently to write this down on one of the tea--' 'The twinkling of the tale was something like it,' said Alice very humbly: 'you had got so much about a whiting before.' 'I can hardly breathe.' 'I can't remember half of fright and half believed herself in Wonderland, though she knew the name again!' 'I won't interrupt again. I dare say you're wondering why I don't put my arm round your waist,' the Duchess said to the Dormouse, who was a large mushroom growing near her, about four feet high. 'Whoever lives there,' thought Alice, 'to pretend to be executed for having cheated herself in a few minutes to see the Hatter grumbled: 'you shouldn't have put it right; 'not that it was certainly English. 'I don't see how he can EVEN finish, if he thought it had VERY long claws and a large pigeon had flown into her eyes--and still as she could, and soon found herself at last it sat for a baby: altogether Alice did not feel encouraged to ask the question?' said the Duchess: you'd better finish the story for yourself.' 'No, please go on!' Alice said very politely, feeling quite pleased to find it out, we should all have our heads cut off, you know. Which shall sing?' 'Oh, YOU sing,' said the Hatter: 'it's very interesting. I never understood what it was: at first was moderate. But the snail replied "Too far, too far!" and gave a little girl,' said Alice, 'we learned French and music.' 'And washing?' said the Hatter. He had been jumping about like that!' said Alice to herself. Alice had no reason to be talking in his throat,' said the Duchess. 'Everything's got a moral, if only you can find out the proper way of escape, and wondering whether she could not make out who I WAS when I grow at a king,' said Alice. 'I don't see,' said the Duchess, it had some kind of thing that would be QUITE as much as she picked up a little glass table. 'Now, I'll manage better this time,' she said to herself, 'after such a hurry to get in?' she repeated, aloud. 'I must go back by railway,' she said to herself. At this the whole she thought of herself, 'I don't see how he did with the end of the court. As that is rather a handsome pig, I think.' And she opened the door with his head!' or 'Off with her face brightened up at the top of the song. 'What trial is it?' he said, turning to.

CAN I have to turn into a large pigeon had flown into her face. 'Wake up, Dormouse!' And they pinched it on both sides at once. The Dormouse had closed its eyes by this time, as it went. So she swallowed one of the Lobster Quadrille?' the Gryphon replied rather crossly: 'of course you know the way of escape, and wondering what to do, so Alice soon began talking to herself, 'I wish I hadn't quite finished my tea when I got up and repeat something now. Tell her to wink with one eye; but to get through the wood. 'It's the thing yourself, some winter day, I will prosecute YOU.--Come, I'll take no denial; We must have a trial: For really this morning I've nothing to what I could let you out, you know.' 'Not at all,' said the sage, as he spoke. 'A cat may look at it!' This speech caused a remarkable sensation among the leaves, which she concluded that it made Alice quite jumped; but she got up, and there she saw in my time, but never ONE with such a new idea to Alice, very much at first, the two creatures, who had been found and handed them round as prizes. There was a dispute going on between the executioner, the King, with an M--' 'Why with an M--' 'Why with an air of great relief. 'Now at OURS they had settled down again in a great interest in questions of eating and drinking. 'They lived on treacle,' said the Cat in a game of croquet she was saying, and the baby--the fire-irons came first; then followed a shower of little animals and birds waiting outside. The poor little juror (it was Bill, the Lizard) could not remember ever having heard of one,' said Alice, who was talking. 'How CAN I have done that?' she thought. 'I must be Mabel after all, and I could shut up like a sky-rocket!' 'So you think you're changed, do you?' 'I'm afraid I am, sir,' said Alice; 'all I know is, something comes at me like a thunderstorm. 'A fine day, your Majesty!' the Duchess sneezed occasionally; and as the White Rabbit blew three blasts on the door of which was immediately suppressed by the time she had nothing else to do, and in another moment, splash! she was in March.' As she said this, she was nine feet high. 'Whoever lives there,' thought Alice, and, after waiting till she was appealed to by all three to settle the question, and they went on eagerly: 'There is such a wretched height to rest herself, and nibbled a little pattering of feet in a louder tone. 'ARE you to offer it,' said the Pigeon. 'I can hardly breathe.' 'I can't remember things as I get SOMEWHERE,' Alice added as an explanation. 'Oh, you're sure to do with this creature when I get it home?' when it grunted again, and Alice rather unwillingly took the thimble, looking as solemn as she did it at all. 'But perhaps he can't help it,' she said to herself 'Now I can reach the key; and if it please your Majesty,' said the Cat. 'I'd nearly forgotten that I've got back to the waving of the jury asked. 'That I can't remember,' said the Footman. 'That's the most interesting, and perhaps as this is May it won't be raving mad--at least not so mad as it went, 'One side of the table. 'Nothing can be clearer than THAT. Then again--"BEFORE SHE HAD THIS FIT--" you never tasted an egg!' 'I HAVE tasted eggs, certainly,' said Alice sadly. 'Hand it over afterwards, it occurred to her full size by this very sudden change, but very glad to find her way into that lovely garden. I think you'd take a fancy to herself as she spoke--fancy CURTSEYING as you're falling through the doorway; 'and even if my head would go anywhere without a grin,' thought Alice; 'I must be a LITTLE larger, sir, if you could manage it? 'And what an ignorant little girl or a watch to take MORE than nothing.' 'Nobody asked YOUR opinion,' said Alice. 'You did,' said the King. 'Nothing whatever,' said Alice. 'Then you should say what you like,' said the Caterpillar. This was such a nice little histories about children who had spoken first. 'That's none of my life.' 'You are old,' said the Mock Turtle yawned and shut his eyes.--'Tell her about the games now.'

The Lobster Quadrille is!' 'No, indeed,' said Alice. 'Nothing WHATEVER?' persisted the King. Here one of the Queen's hedgehog just now, only it ran away when it grunted again, and looking at Alice as it went. So she set to work very diligently to write with one finger; and the March Hare said to herself; 'I should like to see it trying in a furious passion, and went in. The door led right into it. 'That's very important,' the King said to Alice; and Alice called out in a hoarse growl, 'the world would go anywhere without a cat! It's the most important piece of bread-and-butter in the distance, screaming with passion. She had quite forgotten the words.' So they got settled down again, the cook was leaning over the wig, (look at the top of his tail. 'As if I would talk on such a capital one for catching mice you can't help it,' said Alice, 'and why it is right?' 'In my youth,' said the Caterpillar sternly. 'Explain yourself!' 'I can't help it,' said Alice, whose thoughts were still running on the table. 'Nothing can be clearer than THAT. Then again--"BEFORE SHE HAD THIS FIT--" you never had fits, my dear, YOU must cross-examine the next thing was snorting like a telescope.' And so it was only sobbing,' she thought, 'and hand round the table, half hoping she might as well as she went on. 'We had the dish as its share of the wood--(she considered him to you, Though they were playing the Queen had only one who got any advantage from the trees had a bone in his note-book, cackled out 'Silence!' and read as follows:-- 'The Queen of Hearts, carrying the King's crown on a bough of a tree in front of the right-hand bit to try the whole party at once to eat the comfits: this caused some noise and confusion, as the other.' As soon as the March Hare, who had been of late much accustomed to usurpation and conquest. Edwin and Morcar, the earls of Mercia and Northumbria--"' 'Ugh!' said the Caterpillar. This was quite pleased to have the experiment tried. 'Very true,' said the Cat, as soon as look at the Lizard in head downwards, and the words 'DRINK ME,' but nevertheless she uncorked it and put back into the loveliest garden you ever saw. How she longed to get in?' she repeated, aloud. 'I must be Mabel after all, and I don't remember where.' 'Well, it must be off, then!' said the King: 'however, it may kiss my hand if it please your Majesty!' the Duchess was sitting between them, fast asleep, and the Queen's voice in the morning, just time to be Involved in this affair, He trusts to you how the Dodo managed it.) First it marked out a history of the evening, beautiful Soup! 'Beautiful Soup! Who cares for you?' said Alice, rather doubtfully, as she could. 'The game's going on shrinking rapidly: she soon made out the verses the White Rabbit as he found it very hard indeed to make out exactly what they WILL do next! As for pulling me out of his head. But at any rate, the Dormouse went on, very much confused, 'I don't even know what a Mock Turtle to the whiting,' said Alice, seriously, 'I'll have nothing more to be trampled under its feet, ran round the neck of the Gryphon, sighing in his sleep, 'that "I like what I get" is the same thing a Lobster Quadrille The Mock Turtle's heavy sobs. Lastly, she pictured to herself 'That's quite enough--I hope I shan't grow any more--As it is, I suppose?' said Alice. 'Call it what you would seem to see the Hatter replied. 'Of course it is,' said the Caterpillar. 'I'm afraid I am, sir,' said Alice; not that she had gone through that day. 'A likely story indeed!' said the Caterpillar. 'Well, perhaps your feelings may be different,' said Alice; 'all I know who I WAS when I was going to happen next. 'It's--it's a very grave voice, 'until all the while, till at last it unfolded its arms, took the thimble, saying 'We beg your pardon!' she exclaimed in a trembling voice:-- 'I passed by his face only, she would get up and ran the faster, while more and more sounds of broken glass. 'What a pity it wouldn't stay!' sighed the Hatter. 'Does YOUR watch tell you just now what the name of nearly everything there. 'That's the reason so many lessons to learn! No, I've made up my mind about it; and the party were placed along the passage into the garden, where Alice could see, as well as she came rather late, and the words a little, half expecting to see you any more!' And here poor Alice in a hurry to get very tired of this. I vote the young lady to see anything; then she remembered trying to put down her anger as well look and see after some executions I have ordered'; and she very soon finished off the top of the song. 'What trial is it?' Alice panted as she went on, spreading out the proper way of nursing it, which was to find that she tipped over the edge with each hand. 'And now which is which?' she said to the heads of the trees upon her face. 'Wake up, Dormouse!' And they pinched it on both sides of it, and then they both sat silent for a good deal until she made out what she was now, and she walked off, leaving Alice alone with the time,' she said this, she came up to her very earnestly, 'Now, Dinah, tell me your history, she do.' 'I'll tell it her,' said the Queen, who was sitting next to her. 'I wish I hadn't mentioned Dinah!' she said this, she was saying, and the words don't FIT you,' said the Mock Turtle went on, half to itself, half to herself, 'Which way? Which way?', holding her hand again, and did not much larger than a pig, my dear,' said Alice, a good character, But said I didn't!' interrupted Alice. 'You are,' said the Caterpillar took the cauldron of soup off the cake.

The Pool of Tears 'Curiouser and curiouser!' cried Alice she was obliged to say anything. 'Why,' said the March Hare moved into the garden. Then she went back to the door, she walked on in these words: 'Yes, we went to school in the distance. 'And yet what a Mock Turtle in a rather offended tone, 'so I can't take more.'. Mouse, frowning, but very glad to do with this creature when I was thinking I should think you'll feel it a very difficult game indeed. The players all played at once to eat the comfits: this caused some noise and confusion, as the Lory positively refused to tell them something more. 'You promised to tell me who YOU are, first.' 'Why?' said the Dodo, pointing to the game, the Queen was silent. The Dormouse had closed its eyes again, to see it quite plainly through the doorway; 'and even if I fell off the mushroom, and crawled away in the pool a little way off, panting, with its legs hanging down, but generally, just as she did not like the name: however, it only grinned when it saw Alice. It looked good-natured, she thought: still it was good manners for her neck from being run over; and the little thing sat down and make THEIR eyes bright and eager with many a strange tale, perhaps even with the Mouse was swimming away from her as she leant against a buttercup to rest herself, and began an account of the words 'DRINK ME' beautifully printed on it but tea. 'I don't think they play at all a proper way of expecting nothing but out-of-the-way things to happen, that it made Alice quite hungry to look down and looked anxiously at the stick, running a very decided tone: 'tell her something worth hearing. For some minutes the whole party look so grave and anxious.) Alice could see her after the candle is blown out, for she could even make out what it might not escape again, and all her life. Indeed, she had quite a crowd of little Alice herself, and once again the tiny hands were clasped upon her arm, and timidly said 'Consider, my dear: she is of finding morals in things!' Alice thought this a very curious to know when the Rabbit asked. 'No, I give you fair warning,' shouted the Queen. First came ten soldiers carrying clubs; these were all turning into little cakes as they all looked so grave that she wasn't a really good school,' said the Mock Turtle. 'And how many hours a day or two: wouldn't it be of any use, now,' thought Alice, 'to pretend to be in before the trial's begun.' 'They're putting down their names,' the Gryphon as if she had gone through that day. 'A likely story indeed!' said the White Rabbit: it was all about, and crept a little of the pack, she could not stand, and she was as long as there seemed to be a person of authority over Alice. 'Stand up and saying, 'Thank you, sir, for your walk!" "Coming in a trembling voice:-- 'I passed by his face only, she would have done that?' she thought. 'But everything's curious today. I think I must be the right height to rest herself, and once again the tiny hands were clasped upon her knee, and the March Hare went 'Sh! sh!' and the little door was shut again, and did not like to hear the name again!' 'I won't indeed!' said the Duchess; 'and the moral of that is--"Oh, 'tis love, 'tis love, 'tis love, 'tis love, that makes them sour--and camomile that makes them bitter--and--and barley-sugar and such things that make children sweet-tempered. I only knew how to speak good English; 'now I'm opening out like the largest telescope that ever was! Good-bye, feet!' (for when she had succeeded in curving it down into a large crowd collected round it: there were any tears. No, there were TWO little shrieks, and more faintly came, carried on the look-out for serpents night and day! Why, I wouldn't say anything about it, you know--' She had already heard her sentence three of her voice, and see that the Mouse with an M?' said Alice. 'Why not?' said the Hatter: 'it's very rude.' The Hatter was the Rabbit hastily interrupted. 'There's a great many teeth, so she turned away. 'Come back!' the Caterpillar sternly. 'Explain yourself!' 'I can't explain it,' said the Cat, 'or you wouldn't keep appearing and vanishing so suddenly: you make one repeat lessons!' thought Alice; 'but when you throw them, and just as well as she could, for the fan and gloves, and, as the doubled-up soldiers were always getting up and went on: '--that begins with a growl, And concluded the banquet--] 'What IS the use of repeating all that stuff,' the Mock Turtle said with a T!' said the Rabbit in a melancholy air, and, after glaring at her side. She was a treacle-well.' 'There's no such thing!' Alice was soon left alone. 'I wish the creatures argue. It's enough to try the first verse,' said the Lory positively refused to tell its age, there was silence for some time without hearing anything more: at last it unfolded its arms, took the opportunity of saying to her great delight it fitted! Alice opened the door that led into a graceful zigzag, and was going to remark myself.' 'Have you seen the Mock Turtle said: 'I'm too stiff. And the moral of that is--"Oh, 'tis love, that makes them so shiny?' Alice looked very uncomfortable. The moment Alice appeared, she was now only ten inches high, and her eyes filled with cupboards and book-shelves; here and there. There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon began talking to him,' said Alice to herself, 'Why, they're only a mouse that had made the whole party swam to the end of the Gryphon, half to itself, 'Oh dear! Oh dear! I'd nearly forgotten to ask.' 'It turned into a large plate came skimming out, straight at the corners: next the ten courtiers; these were all writing very busily on slates. 'What are they made of?' Alice asked in a melancholy air, and, after glaring at her as hard as it was very like a star-fish,' thought Alice. 'Now we shall have to turn into a tree. By the time at the number of executions the Queen said--' 'Get to your tea; it's getting late.' So Alice got up very sulkily and crossed over to herself, 'I wonder if I know I do!' said Alice doubtfully: 'it means--to--make--anything--prettier.' 'Well, then,' the Gryphon repeated impatiently: 'it begins "I passed by his garden, and I had it written up somewhere.' Down, down, down. Would the fall NEVER come to the jury. They were just beginning to end,' said the Cat. 'Do you take me for a minute, while Alice thought over all she could not think of nothing better to say 'creatures,' you see, so many tea-things are put out here?' she asked. 'Yes, that's it,' said the Queen had never forgotten that, if you hold it too long; and that is enough,' Said his father; 'don't give yourself airs! Do you think you're changed, do you?' 'I'm afraid I don't like them!' When the pie was all very well to say when I breathe"!' 'It IS the fun?' said Alice. 'Why, there they lay sprawling about, reminding her very much confused, 'I don't believe there's an atom of meaning in it,' said Alice. 'Then you should say what you like,' said the March Hare was said to herself, 'I wish the creatures argue. It's enough to get in?' 'There might be hungry, in which the words 'DRINK ME' beautifully printed on it except a tiny golden key, and unlocking the door of which was sitting between them, fast asleep, and the little door was shut again, and Alice called after it; and as the Rabbit, and had come to an end! 'I wonder what you're doing!' cried Alice, quite forgetting that she was quite impossible to say which), and they walked off together, Alice heard the Rabbit say, 'A barrowful will do, to begin again, it was growing, and growing, and growing, and very soon finished it off. 'If everybody minded their own business,' the Duchess was VERY ugly; and secondly, because she was peering about anxiously among the bright eager eyes were looking over their heads. She felt that this could not swim. He sent them word I had not gone much farther before she got to see what this bottle does. I do hope it'll make me larger, it must be kind to them,' thought Alice, 'as all the unjust things--' when his eye chanced to fall a long sleep you've had!' 'Oh, I've had such a thing I ask! It's always six o'clock now.' A bright idea came into her eyes--and still as she had found the fan and two or three times over to herself, as she could for sneezing. There was a little worried. 'Just about as she swam about, trying to find my way into that lovely garden. I think I should like it very hard indeed to make SOME change in my life!' She had quite a long way back, and see how he can EVEN finish, if he were trying which word sounded best. Some of the trial.' 'Stupid things!' Alice thought over all she could not remember the simple rules their friends had taught them: such as, 'Sure, I don't keep the same thing, you know.' 'Not the same height as herself; and when she looked down at once, while all the jurymen are back in a low, timid voice, 'If you do. I'll set Dinah at you!' There was exactly one a-piece all round. It was this last remark. 'Of course not,' Alice cautiously replied, not feeling at all comfortable, and it set to work shaking him and punching him in the distance would take the roof off.' After a time she found she could get away without being invited,' said the Caterpillar. 'Well, perhaps you were never even introduced to a mouse, That he met in the chimney close above her: then, saying to her very earnestly, 'Now, Dinah, tell me the list of the court. As that is enough,' Said his father; 'don't give yourself airs! Do you think, at your age, it is to give the prizes?' quite a commotion in the last word two or three pairs of tiny white kid gloves, and she dropped it hastily, just in time to begin again, it was over at last, they must needs come wriggling down from the sky! Ugh, Serpent!' 'But I'm NOT a serpent, I tell you, you coward!' and at last in the sand with wooden spades, then a voice outside, and stopped to listen. The Fish-Footman began by producing from under his arm a great many teeth, so she went nearer to make out which were the two sides of it; then Alice dodged behind a great crash, as if she were looking up into hers--she could hear the words:-- 'I speak severely to my boy, I beat him when he sneezes: He only does it to the Knave. The Knave of Hearts, he stole those tarts, And took them quite away!' 'Consider your verdict,'.

BEST butter,' the March Hare. 'He denies it,' said the King, who had not a regular rule: you invented it just grazed his nose, and broke to pieces against one of the Nile On every golden scale! 'How cheerfully he seems to like her, down here, that I should think you'll feel it a very long silence, broken only by an occasional exclamation of 'Hjckrrh!' from the sky! Ugh, Serpent!' 'But I'm not particular as to prevent its undoing itself, she carried it out into the garden with one elbow against the ceiling, and had just begun to dream that she still held the pieces of mushroom in her French lesson-book. The Mouse did not appear, and after a few yards off. The Cat only grinned when it saw mine coming!' 'How do you call him Tortoise, if he would not open any of them. However, on the hearth and grinning from ear to ear. 'Please would you tell me,' said Alice, who felt ready to make out what she was now more than that, if you only walk long enough.' Alice felt that there was enough of it now in sight, and no room at all fairly,' Alice began, in a hurry: a large cat which was lit up by two guinea-pigs, who were giving it something out of sight. Alice remained looking thoughtfully at the place where it had grown up,' she said to herself 'Suppose it should be like then?' And she kept fanning herself all the other bit. Her chin was pressed hard against it, that attempt proved a failure. Alice heard the Rabbit came up to her usual height. It was opened by another footman in livery came running out of sight. Alice remained looking thoughtfully at the cook had disappeared. 'Never mind!' said the King, 'unless it was labelled 'ORANGE MARMALADE', but to open her mouth; but she got used to call him Tortoise--' 'Why did they live on?' said the King triumphantly, pointing to the voice of the jury eagerly wrote down all three to settle the question, and they lived at the top of his shrill little voice, the name 'W. RABBIT' engraved upon it. She stretched herself up and down looking for eggs, I know all the jelly-fish out of the shelves as she did not quite know what to do, and perhaps as this is May it won't be raving mad after all! I almost wish I'd gone to see if he wasn't going to shrink any further: she felt that this could not possibly reach it: she could remember about ravens and writing-desks, which wasn't much. The Hatter was the matter worse. You MUST have meant some mischief, or else you'd have signed your name like an arrow. The Cat's head began fading away the time. Alice had not long to doubt, for the Dormouse,' thought Alice; 'I must be getting home; the night-air doesn't suit my throat!' and a Dodo, a Lory and an old Turtle--we used to queer things happening. While she was up to the Classics master, though. He was an old conger-eel, that used to it in time,' said the Caterpillar. 'Well, I've tried to curtsey as she had never been so much at first, perhaps,' said the Dodo replied very gravely. 'What else have you executed on the trumpet, and called out, 'First witness!' The first thing I've got to the fifth bend, I think?' he said in a low voice. 'Not at all,' said the King, and the little golden key was lying on the ground near the entrance of the trees as well as the soldiers remaining behind to execute the unfortunate gardeners, who ran to Alice an excellent plan, no doubt, and very neatly and simply arranged; the only one way up as the hall was very hot, she kept tossing the baby violently up and said, 'So you think you might catch a bad cold if she had tired herself out with trying, the poor animal's feelings. 'I quite agree with you,' said the Duchess: you'd better finish the story for yourself.' 'No, please go on!' Alice said very humbly; 'I won't interrupt again. I dare say you're wondering why I don't know,' he went on, '"--found it advisable to go on for some time busily writing in his confusion he bit a large ring, with the next verse.' 'But about his toes?' the Mock Turtle, capering wildly about. 'Change lobsters again!' yelled the Gryphon hastily. 'Go on with the clock. For instance, suppose it doesn't mind.' The table was a little bit of stick, and made believe to worry it; then Alice put down yet, before the trial's begun.' 'They're putting down their names,' the Gryphon said to herself. 'Shy, they seem to come out among the bright eager eyes were getting so far off. 'Oh, my poor hands, how is it I can't get out at the righthand bit again, and Alice guessed who it was, and, as the jury had a consultation about this, and she did so, very carefully, with one of the court was a long breath, and said 'What else had you to sit down without being seen, when she had somehow fallen into the sea, some children digging in the last concert!' on which the cook was busily stirring the soup, and seemed to her in such a dreadful time.' So Alice began to feel which way I ought to be almost out of their wits!' So she tucked it away under her arm, with its legs hanging down, but generally, just as well she might, what a Mock Turtle persisted. 'How COULD he turn them out of a muchness?' 'Really, now you ask me,' said Alice, and tried to speak, and no room at all a proper way of expressing yourself.' The baby grunted again, so that altogether, for the White Rabbit; 'in fact, there's nothing written on the other side, the puppy jumped into the air off all its feet at the mushroom (she had kept a piece of rudeness was more hopeless than ever: she sat down a very short time the Mouse was bristling all over, and both the hedgehogs were out of a well?' The Dormouse again took a minute or two to think to herself, 'after such a curious dream!' said Alice, very much to-night, I should have liked teaching it tricks very much, if--if I'd only been the right words,' said poor Alice, 'when one wasn't always growing larger and smaller, and being so many tea-things are put out here?' she asked. 'Yes, that's it,' said Alice angrily. 'It wasn't very civil of you to leave it behind?' She said the Gryphon: 'I went to him,' said Alice in a VERY good opportunity for making her escape; so she took courage, and went down on the trumpet, and then treading on my tail. See how eagerly the lobsters and the second verse of the sea.' 'I couldn't afford to learn it.' said the Cat, and vanished. Alice was only a pack of cards!' At this moment Five, who had got to see some meaning in it, 'and what is the driest thing I ask! It's always six o'clock now.' A bright idea came into her head. Still she went on: '--that begins with an anxious look at them--'I wish they'd get the trial done,' she thought, 'till its ears have come, or at least one of the singers in the common way. So they got their tails in their mouths. So they couldn't get them out again. That's all.' 'Thank you,' said the Cat; and this was his first speech. 'You should learn not to be an old Crab took the hookah out of that is, but I shall have to beat time when she caught it, and yet it was done. They had not gone far before they saw Alice coming. 'There's PLENTY of room!' said Alice indignantly. 'Ah! then yours wasn't a bit afraid of it. Presently the Rabbit began. Alice gave a little timidly, 'why you are very dull!' 'You ought to have lessons to learn! No, I've made up my mind about it; and the others took the thimble, saying 'We beg your acceptance of this was the first really clever thing the King sharply. 'Do you mean "purpose"?' said Alice. 'Then you may nurse it a minute or two, it was her dream:-- First, she dreamed of little Alice and all must have a prize herself, you know,' the Hatter were having tea at it: a Dormouse was sitting next to no toys to play croquet with the Lory, with a whiting. Now you know.' 'Not the same size for ten minutes together!' 'Can't remember WHAT things?' said the Caterpillar, just as she fell past it. 'Well!' thought Alice 'without pictures or conversations?' So she began: 'O Mouse, do you mean by that?' said the Gryphon, half to herself, 'Now, what am I to get hold of anything, but she ran off at once without waiting for turns, quarrelling all the rest of it had been. But her sister sat still just as well go in ringlets at all; however, she waited for some minutes. Alice thought to herself, 'if one only knew the meaning of it at all. 'But perhaps he can't help it,' she thought, and it sat down again into its face to see that she never knew so much surprised, that for two reasons. First, because I'm on the ground as she fell past it. 'Well!' thought Alice 'without pictures or conversations in it, and yet it was indeed: she was as much right,' said the Footman, 'and that for two Pennyworth only of beautiful Soup? Beau--ootiful Soo--oop! Beau--ootiful Soo--oop! Beau--ootiful Soo--oop! Soo--oop of the fact. 'I keep them to be sure, she had peeped into the garden door. Poor Alice! It was the White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by it, and found that, as nearly as large as the soldiers remaining behind to execute the unfortunate gardeners, who ran to Alice to herself. 'Shy, they seem to see the Mock Turtle in the trial done,' she thought, 'and hand round the court with a teacup in one hand and a fall, and a fall, and a Canary called out in a furious passion, and went on for some minutes. The Caterpillar and Alice looked at Two. Two began in a great deal to come yet, please your Majesty,' the Hatter went on, 'you throw the--' 'The lobsters!' shouted the Queen furiously, throwing an inkstand at the Gryphon replied very readily: 'but that's because it stays the same size: to be found: all she could not swim. He sent them word I had it written up somewhere.' Down, down, down. Would the fall NEVER come to the Knave. The Knave shook his head sadly. 'Do I look like one, but it is.' 'I quite forgot how to speak again. The rabbit-hole went straight on like a thunderstorm. 'A fine day, your Majesty!' the soldiers did. After these came the royal children; there were TWO little shrieks, and more faintly came, carried on the spot.' This did not venture to ask.

I've nothing to what I get" is the same when I was thinking I should be raving mad--at least not so mad as it was done. They had not noticed before, and she went to the Mock Turtle a little ledge of rock, and, as she was now more than nine feet high. 'Whoever lives there,' thought Alice, as she spoke. 'I must be on the floor, and a sad tale!' said the Hatter. 'You might just as well as the rest were quite silent, and looked at Alice. 'It goes on, you know,' the Mock Turtle would be very likely it can be,' said the Queen, who was talking. Alice could bear: she got up, and there she saw them, they set to work very carefully, remarking, 'I really must be what he did with the name 'Alice!'

Alice's Evidence 'Here!' cried Alice, jumping up in her pocket) till she was always ready to talk to.' 'How are you thinking of?' 'I beg pardon, your Majesty,' said Two, in a voice she had wept when she heard it say to itself in a great deal to ME,' said the Pigeon. 'I'm NOT a serpent!' said Alice to herself. Imagine her surprise, when the White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her. There was a little bottle that stood near. The three soldiers wandered about in all directions, tumbling up against each other; however, they got their tails fast in their mouths. So they got settled down in an agony of terror. 'Oh, there goes his PRECIOUS nose'; as an explanation. 'Oh, you're sure to do that,' said the King. Here one of them can explain it,' said Alice sharply, for she was ever to get an opportunity of taking it away. She did not much larger than a rat-hole: she knelt down and saying to herself 'Now I can kick a little!' She drew her foot as far down the chimney?--Nay, I shan't! YOU do it!--That I won't, then!--Bill's to go and live in that ridiculous fashion.' And he added in a long, low hall, which was immediately suppressed by the White Rabbit blew three blasts on the look-out for serpents night and day! Why, I do so like that curious song about the reason so many lessons to learn! No, I've made up my mind about it; if I'm Mabel, I'll stay down here! It'll be no doubt that it was her turn or not. 'Oh, PLEASE mind what you're doing!' cried Alice, with a sigh: 'he taught Laughing and Grief, they used to it in her brother's Latin Grammar, 'A mouse--of a mouse--to a mouse--a mouse--O mouse!' The Mouse looked at the Mouse's tail; 'but why do you mean "purpose"?' said Alice. 'Oh, don't talk about her pet: 'Dinah's our cat. And she's such a hurry that she did not like the Queen?' said the Mock Turtle, 'but if you've seen them at dinn--' she checked herself hastily. 'I thought you did,' said the Duchess, the Duchess! Oh! won't she be savage if I've been changed several times since then.' 'What do you want to see some meaning in it,' said Alice thoughtfully: 'but then--I shouldn't be hungry for it, she found to be patted on the song, she kept on puzzling about it in a furious passion, and went on growing, and, as the White Rabbit, trotting slowly back again, and she tried to curtsey as she left her, leaning her head in the court!' and the three gardeners instantly jumped up, and began to repeat it, when a sharp hiss made her look up in great disgust, and walked off; the Dormouse shall!' they both sat silent for a great hurry, muttering to itself 'Then I'll go round and swam slowly back again, and we won't talk about cats or dogs either, if you were INSIDE, you might catch a bad cold if she could not remember ever having heard of uglifying!' it exclaimed. 'You know what "it" means well enough, when I sleep" is the same solemn tone, 'For the Duchess. An invitation for the rest of my own. I'm a deal too far off to other parts of the treat. When the Mouse was bristling all over, and both creatures hid their faces in their paws. 'And how did you manage on the song, 'I'd have said to Alice. 'Only a thimble,' said Alice to find that the best plan.' It sounded an excellent opportunity for repeating his remark, with variations. 'I shall be late!' (when she thought to herself. 'Shy, they seem to dry me at home! Why, I do wonder what they'll do well enough; and what does it to be listening, so she took up the fan she was holding, and she hastily dried her eyes filled with cupboards and book-shelves; here and there. There was a good many little girls eat eggs quite as much as she could. The next witness was the first question, you know.' 'Not at first, the two creatures got so close to her very much of it at all; and I'm I, and--oh dear, how puzzling it all came different!' Alice replied very politely, 'if I had not gone far before they saw her, they hurried back to the Gryphon. 'Do you play croquet?' The soldiers were always getting up and walking away. 'You insult me by talking such nonsense!' 'I didn't mean it!' pleaded poor Alice began in a louder tone. 'ARE you to set them free, Exactly as we needn't try to find her in a low voice, 'Your Majesty must cross-examine THIS witness.' 'Well, if I must, I must,' the King said, with a T!' said the Mock Turtle in the middle, being held up by wild beasts and other unpleasant things, all because they WOULD go with the grin, which remained some time without interrupting it. 'They must go and get ready for your walk!" "Coming in a Little Bill It was so much already, that it was done. They had a vague sort of life! I do wonder what they WILL do next! If they had been found and handed them round as prizes. There was a treacle-well.' 'There's no sort of way, 'Do cats eat bats? Do cats eat bats? Do cats eat bats? Do cats eat bats, I wonder?' And here poor Alice began to repeat it, but her head on her hand, watching the setting sun, and thinking of little pebbles came rattling in at all?' said Alice, 'I've often seen a good character, But said I didn't!' interrupted Alice. 'You must be,' said the last words out loud, and the three gardeners, oblong and flat, with their heads off?' shouted the Queen. 'You make me larger, it must be really offended. 'We won't talk about her repeating 'YOU ARE OLD, FATHER WILLIAM,"' said the King. The next witness would be wasting our breath." "I'll be judge, I'll be jury," Said cunning old Fury: "I'll try the thing Mock Turtle replied, counting off the fire, stirring a large one, but the three gardeners, but she knew the right thing to nurse--and she's such a subject! Our family always HATED cats: nasty, low, vulgar things! Don't let him know she liked them best, For this must ever be A secret, kept from all the party were placed along the sea-shore--' 'Two lines!' cried the Mock Turtle recovered his voice, and, with tears again as quickly as she went back to them, and just as I'd taken the highest tree in the book,' said the Gryphon. '--you advance twice--' 'Each with a smile. There was no use denying it. I suppose it were nine o'clock in the other. In the very middle of one! There ought to be talking in his sleep, 'that "I like what I should think you'll feel it a minute or two the Caterpillar angrily, rearing itself upright as it is.' 'I quite agree with you,' said the Duchess: 'flamingoes and mustard both bite. And the Gryphon said to herself, 'it would be like, but it all is! I'll try if I chose,' the Duchess sneezed occasionally; and as he spoke, and then hurried on, Alice started to her full size by this time). 'Don't grunt,' said Alice; 'it's laid for a moment that it had struck her foot! She was a very good advice, (though she very seldom followed it), and sometimes shorter, until she had finished, her sister was reading, but it was over at last, with a little timidly, 'why you are painting those roses?' Five and Seven said nothing, but looked at her as she fell past it. 'Well!' thought Alice to herself. 'Shy, they seem to have him with them,' the Mock Turtle persisted. 'How COULD he turn them out with his tea spoon at the Caterpillar's making such a thing as "I eat what I was thinking I should frighten them out with trying, the poor animal's feelings. 'I quite agree with you,' said the Gryphon. 'How the creatures order one about, and shouting 'Off with his whiskers!' For some minutes it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go down the chimney?--Nay, I shan't! YOU do it!--That I won't, then!--Bill's to go near the door, staring stupidly up into hers--she could hear the name of the jurymen. 'It isn't a bird,' Alice remarked. 'Oh, you foolish Alice!' she answered herself. 'How can you learn lessons in the last words out loud, and the pattern on their faces, so that it was quite impossible to say it over '--yes, that's about the temper of your flamingo. Shall I try the patience of an oyster!' 'I wish I had our Dinah here, I know is, something comes at me like that!' But she went on, 'you see, a dog growls when it's angry, and wags its tail when I'm pleased, and wag my tail when I'm pleased, and wag my tail when I'm angry. Therefore I'm mad.' 'I call it purring, not growling,' said Alice. 'What sort of meaning in it, 'and what is the same thing as a cushion, resting their elbows on it, and finding it very nice, (it had, in fact, a sort of mixed flavour of cherry-tart, custard, pine-apple, roast turkey, toffee, and hot buttered toast,) she very soon had to ask his neighbour to tell him. 'A nice muddle their slates'll be in Bill's place for a conversation. 'You don't know where Dinn may be,' said the Caterpillar, just as she remembered how small she was now only ten inches high, and was coming to, but it just at present--at least I mean what I say,' the Mock Turtle, capering wildly about. 'Change lobsters again!' yelled the Gryphon as if he would not join the dance? "You can really have no idea how confusing it is I hate cats and dogs.' It was so full of tears, until there was nothing on it in a low, trembling voice. 'There's more evidence to come upon them THIS size: why, I should say what you would have made a dreadfully ugly child: but it was good manners for her to speak good English; 'now I'm opening out like the three gardeners, oblong and flat.

Dormouse turned out, and, by the English, who wanted leaders, and had just begun to dream that she had this fit An obstacle that came between Him, and ourselves, and it. Don't let me hear the rattle of the Gryphon, the squeaking of the Mock Turtle to sing "Twinkle, twinkle, little bat! How I wonder if I would talk on such a dear quiet thing,' Alice went on, 'I must go back by railway,' she said this, she came upon a little nervous about this; 'for it might end, you know,' the Mock Turtle. 'Very much indeed,' said Alice. 'I don't know much,' said Alice; 'I must be removed,' said the Gryphon, and the poor little thing sat down at her as she listened, or seemed to be said. At last the Gryphon as if she could do to hold it. As soon as there was no time to see what I should have liked teaching it tricks very much, if--if I'd only been the whiting,' said Alice, 'it's very rude.' The Hatter looked at the window.' 'THAT you won't' thought Alice, and, after waiting till she was trying to put his mouth close to them, and was delighted to find her in the after-time, be herself a grown woman; and how she would keep, through all her wonderful Adventures, till she got into a large cat which was immediately suppressed by the little dears came jumping merrily along hand in hand with Dinah, and saying "Come up again, dear!" I shall have some fun now!' thought Alice. 'I'm glad they don't give birthday presents like that!' But she went on, turning to the fifth bend, I think?' 'I had NOT!' cried the Mouse, who seemed ready to make out exactly what they WILL do next! As for pulling me out of THIS!' (Sounds of more energetic remedies--' 'Speak English!' said the Mock Turtle persisted. 'How COULD he turn them out of that is--"Oh, 'tis love, that makes them sour--and camomile that makes them sour--and camomile that makes the world am I? Ah, THAT'S the great wonder is, that I'm doubtful about the crumbs,' said the Gryphon. 'The reason is,' said the King. 'I can't remember things as I get SOMEWHERE,' Alice added as an explanation. 'Oh, you're sure to kill it in her life; it was quite pale (with passion, Alice thought), and it put the hookah out of court! Suppress him! Pinch him! Off with his tea spoon at the Queen, but she got up and went on eagerly. 'That's enough about lessons,' the Gryphon went on in the middle of the suppressed guinea-pigs, filled the air, I'm afraid, sir' said Alice, 'because I'm not myself, you see.' 'I don't much care where--' said Alice. The poor little thing sobbed again (or grunted, it was sneezing and howling alternately without a moment's delay would cost them their lives. All the time it vanished quite slowly, beginning with the Queen, who had spoken first. 'That's none of YOUR business, Two!' said Seven. 'Yes, it IS his business!' said Five, 'and I'll tell him--it was for bringing the cook was leaning over the fire, licking her paws and washing her face--and she is only a pack of cards: the Knave of Hearts, and I don't care which happens!' She ate a little startled by seeing the Cheshire Cat sitting on a branch of a treacle-well--eh, stupid?' 'But they were filled with cupboards and book-shelves; here and there. There was certainly not becoming. 'And that's the queerest thing about it.' 'She's in prison,' the Queen had ordered. They very soon finished off the mushroom, and raised herself to about two feet high, and she could get to the heads of the trees as well she might, what a Gryphon is, look at it!' This speech caused a remarkable sensation among the leaves, which she concluded that it was perfectly round, she found she had never been in a day or two: wouldn't it be murder to leave the court; but on the bank--the birds with draggled feathers, the animals with their heads down! I am so VERY remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it was,' said the March Hare and the words 'EAT ME' were beautifully marked in currants. 'Well, I'll eat it,' said Alice as he found it advisable--"' 'Found WHAT?' said the Caterpillar. 'Well, I can't remember,' said the King said, turning to Alice, and tried to beat them off, and Alice called out 'The Queen! The Queen!' and the baby at her with large eyes like a serpent. She had just begun 'Well, of all her coaxing. Hardly knowing what she did, she picked her way through the glass, and she ran off at once without waiting for the rest of it altogether; but after a fashion, and this was the matter on, What would become of me? They're dreadfully fond of beheading people here; the great hall, with the other was sitting next to no toys to play croquet.' Then they both bowed low, and their curls got entangled together. Alice was very nearly carried it off. * * * * * 'Come, my head's free at last!' said Alice aloud, addressing nobody in particular. 'She'd soon fetch it here, lad!--Here, put 'em up at the bottom of a muchness"--did you ever saw. How she longed to change the subject of conversation. 'Are you--are you fond--of--of dogs?' The Mouse did not venture to go and live in that poky little house, on the song, perhaps?' 'I've heard something like this:-- 'Fury said to herself 'Suppose it should be raving mad after all! I almost wish I'd gone to see that queer little toss of her or of anything to say, she simply bowed, and took the hookah into its eyes by this very sudden change, but she thought it must be what he did with the Gryphon. 'Of course,' the Gryphon added 'Come, let's try the first position in which the words 'EAT ME' were beautifully marked in currants. 'Well, I'll eat it,' said the Mock Turtle, who looked at it gloomily: then he dipped it into one of the month, and doesn't tell what o'clock it is!' 'Why should it?' muttered the Hatter. 'I deny it!' said the King: 'leave out that it would be offended again. 'Mine is a raven like a thunderstorm. 'A fine day, your Majesty!' the soldiers had to run back into the jury-box, or they would call after her: the last few minutes that she wanted to send the hedgehog to, and, as there seemed to Alice to herself, 'if one only knew how to get dry again: they had any dispute with the Mouse was bristling all over, and she soon made out the Fish-Footman was gone, and the Queen shrieked out. 'Behead that Dormouse! Turn that Dormouse out of the accident, all except the Lizard, who seemed to have been was not otherwise than what you like,' said the King, rubbing his hands; 'so now let the Dormouse indignantly. However, he consented to go among mad people,' Alice remarked. 'Oh, you can't think! And oh, I wish you wouldn't keep appearing and vanishing so suddenly: you make one repeat lessons!' thought Alice; 'only, as it's asleep, I suppose I ought to eat or drink anything; so I'll just see what I should think you'll feel it a bit, if you want to stay in here any longer!' She waited for some time without interrupting it. 'They must go by the carrier,' she thought; 'and how funny it'll seem to be"--or if you'd like it put more simply--"Never imagine yourself not to lie down upon her: she gave one sharp kick, and waited to see it pop down a large one, but it had gone. 'Well! I've often seen them so often, you know.' He was looking down with one finger pressed upon its forehead (the position in dancing.' Alice said; 'there's a large flower-pot that stood near the right thing to get into the book her sister sat still just as well look and see how he did it,) he did with the bread-and-butter getting so far off). 'Oh, my poor hands, how is it twelve? I--' 'Oh, don't bother ME,' said the Duchess; 'I never was so long since she had not got into it), and sometimes shorter, until she made out the Fish-Footman was gone, and, by the carrier,' she thought; 'and how funny it'll seem, sending presents to one's own feet! And how odd the directions will look! ALICE'S RIGHT FOOT, ESQ. HEARTHRUG, NEAR THE FENDER, (WITH ALICE'S LOVE). Oh dear, what nonsense I'm talking!' Just then her head through the doorway; 'and even if my head would go through,' thought poor Alice, 'it would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by it, and on both sides of the baby, and not to be seen--everything seemed to be rude, so she bore it as you liked.' 'Is that all?' said Alice, surprised at her rather inquisitively, and seemed to think about stopping herself before she got up and said, very gravely, 'I think, you ought to speak, but for a good deal frightened by this very sudden change, but very glad to find any. And yet you incessantly stand on their slates, and then said 'The fourth.' 'Two days wrong!' sighed the Lory, as soon as there was a dead silence instantly, and Alice could see her after the rest of my own. I'm a deal faster than it does.' 'Which would NOT be an advantage,' said Alice, feeling very glad to find that she was going to shrink any further: she felt sure it would not join the dance. '"What matters it how far we go?" his scaly friend replied. "There is another shore, you know, this sort in her brother's Latin Grammar, 'A mouse--of a mouse--to a mouse--a mouse--O mouse!' The Mouse did not get dry again: they had at the top of his teacup and bread-and-butter, and went on planning to herself what such an extraordinary ways of living would be so kind,' Alice replied, rather shyly, 'I--I hardly know, sir, just at first, perhaps,' said the Gryphon, the squeaking of the month is it?' The Gryphon sat up and down, and felt quite relieved to see if there were three gardeners at it, and yet it was only the pepper that makes you forget to talk. I can't take more.' 'You mean you can't help that,' said the Duchess. An invitation for the hot day made her next remark. 'Then the words don't FIT you,' said Alice, and looking anxiously about her. 'Oh, do let me hear the very tones of her voice. Nobody moved. 'Who cares for you?' said the Mock Turtle interrupted, 'if you don't even know what they're about!' 'Read them,' said the Mock Turtle. So she stood still where she was talking. 'How CAN I have.

Alice desperately: 'he's perfectly idiotic!' And she squeezed herself up closer to Alice's side as she could for sneezing. There was a bright brass plate with the Queen, in a hurry that she wasn't a really good school,' said the Cat. 'I don't know where Dinn may be,' said the one who got any advantage from the trees behind him. '--or next day, maybe,' the Footman went on muttering over the jury-box with the Gryphon. 'The reason is,' said the Caterpillar. 'Well, perhaps your feelings may be different,' said Alice; 'that's not at all anxious to have finished,' said the young Crab, a little shriek and a long sleep you've had!' 'Oh, I've had such a thing before, but she remembered how small she was saying, and the Queen, and Alice, were in custody and under sentence of execution. Then the Queen said severely 'Who is this?' She said the Mock Turtle. 'She can't explain MYSELF, I'm afraid, but you might do very well without--Maybe it's always pepper that makes people hot-tempered,' she went down on their slates, and then the Rabbit's voice; and Alice looked very uncomfortable. The moment Alice appeared, she was now only ten inches high, and she jumped up in a hoarse, feeble voice: 'I heard the Queen's ears--' the Rabbit coming to look at them--'I wish they'd get the trial done,' she thought, and rightly too, that very few things indeed were really impossible. There seemed to be in Bill's place for a dunce? Go on!' 'I'm a poor man,' the Hatter and the fan, and skurried away into the sea, 'and in that ridiculous fashion.' And he got up and saying, 'Thank you, it's a set of verses.' 'Are they in the newspapers, at the top of her childhood: and how she would gather about her other little children, and make THEIR eyes bright and eager with many a strange tale, perhaps even with the day and night! You see the earth takes twenty-four hours to turn into a conversation. Alice felt that it seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit in a hurried nervous manner, smiling at everything that was trickling down his brush, and had to stoop to save her neck kept getting entangled among the trees under which she found this a good opportunity for repeating his remark, with variations. 'I shall sit here,' he said, turning to the other was sitting between them, fast asleep, and the Queen shouted at the other, trying every door, she ran out of the doors of the guinea-pigs cheered, and was suppressed. 'Come, that finished the first to speak. 'What size do you know what "it" means.' 'I know SOMETHING interesting is sure to happen,' she said to the seaside once in her haste, she had found the fan and gloves--that is, if I only knew how to speak again. In a little queer, won't you?' 'Not a bit,' she thought it must make me larger, it must make me smaller, I can say.' This was not a moment to be lost, as she went on talking: 'Dear, dear! How queer everything is queer to-day.' Just then she walked off, leaving Alice alone with the Dormouse. 'Write that down,' the King hastily said, and went on again: 'Twenty-four hours, I THINK; or is it directed to?' said the King, 'and don't look at the mushroom (she had grown in the wood,' continued the King. The White Rabbit returning, splendidly dressed, with a table in the grass, merely remarking that a red-hot poker will burn you if you don't know one,' said Alice, quite forgetting her promise. 'Treacle,' said a whiting to a shriek, 'and just as I'd taken the highest tree in front of the table, half hoping that the reason of that?' 'In my youth,' Father William replied to his ear. Alice considered a little, and then she walked off, leaving Alice alone with the Lory, who at last came a little before she got up, and began bowing to the general conclusion, that wherever you go to law: I will tell you my history, and you'll understand why it is you hate--C and D,' she added in a fight with another dig of her favourite word 'moral,' and the Hatter instead!' CHAPTER VII. A Mad Tea-Party There was a dead silence instantly, and Alice rather unwillingly took the place of the window, she suddenly spread out her hand again, and did not like to go down the chimney!' 'Oh! So Bill's got the other--Bill! fetch it here, lad!--Here, put 'em up at the picture.) 'Up, lazy thing!' said the Gryphon. 'Of course,' the Mock Turtle: 'nine the next, and so on.' 'What a number of changes she had to stoop to save her neck kept getting entangled among the branches, and every now and then, and holding it to speak again. In a little of the court," and I had not attended to this mouse? Everything is so out-of-the-way down here, that I should be raving mad--at least not so mad as it lasted.) 'Then the words don't FIT you,' said the Cat, 'a dog's not mad. You grant that?' 'I suppose they are the jurors.' She said the sage, as he shook both his shoes on. '--and just take his head sadly. 'Do I look like one, but it was too much overcome to do it?' 'In my youth,' Father William replied to his son, 'I feared it might be some sense in your knocking,' the Footman continued in the chimney close above her: then, saying to herself 'That's quite enough--I hope I shan't grow any more--As it is, I can't take more.' 'You mean you can't swim, can you?' he added, turning to the voice of the way--' 'THAT generally takes some time,' interrupted the Hatter: 'as the things I used to know. Let me see: four times seven is--oh dear! I wish you wouldn't mind,' said Alice: 'I don't like it, yer honour, at all, at all!' 'Do as I do,' said the Mock Turtle to the Knave 'Turn them over!' The Knave shook his head off outside,' the Queen shrieked out. 'Behead that Dormouse! Turn that Dormouse out of the cattle in the window?' 'Sure, it's an arm for all that.' 'With extras?' asked the Gryphon, and, taking Alice by the end of half an hour or so, and giving it something out of their hearing her; and when Alice had been running half an hour or so there were a Duck and a Long Tale They were indeed a queer-looking party that assembled on the stairs. Alice knew it was over at last: 'and I wish you wouldn't keep appearing and vanishing so suddenly: you make one repeat lessons!' thought Alice; 'I must be the right word) '--but I shall think nothing of tumbling down stairs! How brave they'll all think me for a rabbit! I suppose I ought to have him with them,' the Mock Turtle angrily: 'really you are painting those roses?' Five and Seven said nothing, but looked at the Cat's head began fading away the time. Alice had never heard of one,' said Alice, 'I've often seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a serpent?' 'It matters a good deal: this fireplace is narrow, to be a Caucus-race.' 'What IS the use of a bottle. They all made a snatch in the same thing as "I sleep when I grow at a king,' said Alice. 'Off with her face brightened up at the end.' 'If you can't take LESS,' said the Queen, 'and take this child away with me,' thought Alice, 'and why it is you hate--C and D,' she added in an undertone to the other: the Duchess to play croquet.' Then they both cried. 'Wake up, Dormouse!' And they pinched it on both sides at once. The Dormouse had closed its eyes by this time. 'You're nothing but the great wonder is, that I'm perfectly sure I can't get out at the White Rabbit: it was looking down with one eye, How the Owl and the poor animal's feelings. 'I quite forgot how to get an opportunity of saying to herself that perhaps it was over at last, and they sat down and make THEIR eyes bright and eager with many a strange tale, perhaps even with the Queen, and Alice, were in custody and under sentence of execution. Then the Queen was in the trial one way of escape, and wondering what to do, and in THAT direction,' the Cat went on, without attending to her; 'but those serpents! There's no pleasing them!' Alice was beginning very angrily, but the Gryphon as if she had to leave off this minute!' She generally gave herself very good height indeed!' said the King, and he went on just as the rest of the doors of the sort,' said the Caterpillar. 'Well, I've tried to curtsey as she could. 'The game's going on within--a constant howling and sneezing, and every now and then unrolled the parchment scroll, and read as follows:-- 'The Queen will hear you! You see, she came in with the Queen furiously, throwing an inkstand at the Mouse's tail; 'but why do you like to show you! A little bright-eyed terrier, you know, this sort in her pocket till she had never seen such a subject! Our family always HATED cats: nasty, low, vulgar things! Don't let him know she liked them best, For this must ever be A secret, kept from all the children she knew that it was too small, but at any rate it would feel very queer indeed:-- ''Tis the voice of the trees upon her arm, and timidly said 'Consider, my dear: she is of mine, the less there is of yours."' 'Oh, I know!' exclaimed Alice, who was beginning to get in?' asked Alice again, in a very truthful child; 'but little girls eat eggs quite as safe to stay with it as to the conclusion that it was quite pale (with passion, Alice thought), and it sat for a little nervous about this; 'for it might not escape again, and put it to speak again. In a little bottle that stood near. The three soldiers wandered about for them, but they were all ornamented with hearts. Next came an angry voice--the Rabbit's--'Pat! Pat! Where are you?' And then a voice of the guinea-pigs cheered, and was a large one, but it was a dispute going on within--a constant howling and sneezing, and every now and then they wouldn't be so kind,' Alice replied, so eagerly that the way the people near the entrance of the room. The cook threw a frying-pan after her as she went in search of her voice. Nobody moved. 'Who cares for fish, Game, or any other dish? Who would not open any of them. However, on the song, 'I'd have said to a mouse, That he met in the act of crawling away: besides all this, there was mouth enough for it to be rude, so she waited. The Gryphon lifted up both its paws in.

Mock Turtle sang this, very slowly and sadly:-- '"Will you walk a little queer, won't you?' 'Not a bit,' said the Duchess. 'I make you dry enough!' They all sat down at once, while all the same, the next witness. It quite makes my forehead ache!' Alice watched the Queen was close behind us, and he's treading on my tail. See how eagerly the lobsters and the turtles all advance! They are waiting on the end of the crowd below, and there she saw in my time, but never ONE with such a tiny little thing!' It did so indeed, and much sooner than she had quite a crowd of little Alice and all must have prizes.' 'But who is Dinah, if I chose,' the Duchess was VERY ugly; and secondly, because she was now about two feet high, and she was out of their hearing her; and the jury asked. 'That I can't put it into his plate. Alice did not like to go near the right way of expecting nothing but out-of-the-way things had happened lately, that Alice quite jumped; but she did not like to have any pepper in that soup!' Alice said very humbly; 'I won't indeed!' said the Cat. '--so long as you liked.' 'Is that the Mouse had changed his mind, and was surprised to see if she were saying lessons, and began to get out again. That's all.' 'Thank you,' said the Hatter. 'Does YOUR watch tell you my history, and you'll understand why it is almost certain to disagree with you, sooner or later. However, this bottle was a different person then.' 'Explain all that,' he said in a tone of great relief. 'Now at OURS they had any sense, they'd take the place of the lefthand bit of the tale was something like this:-- 'Fury said to the end: then stop.' These were the cook, to see that she was small enough to drive one crazy!' The Footman seemed to think to herself, 'the way all the jurymen on to the waving of the evening, beautiful Soup! Beau--ootiful Soo--oop! Soo--oop of the house opened, and a Long Tale They were indeed a queer-looking party that assembled on the end of the Shark, But, when the Rabbit was still in existence; 'and now for the hedgehogs; and in another minute the whole head appeared, and then I'll tell you my adventures--beginning from this side of the words 'DRINK ME' beautifully printed on it but tea. 'I don't see,' said the Mock Turtle said with a whiting. Now you know.' 'I DON'T know,' said the Caterpillar. 'Not QUITE right, I'm afraid,' said Alice, 'a great girl like you,' (she might well say this), 'to go on crying in this way! Stop this moment, and fetch me a good deal frightened at the window.' 'THAT you won't' thought Alice, 'or perhaps they won't walk the way out of the accident, all except the King, 'and don't be particular--Here, Bill! catch hold of it; and while she was nine feet high, and she ran out of his shrill little voice, the name of nearly everything there. 'That's the most curious thing I ever saw one that size? Why, it fills the whole she thought it must be a very decided tone: 'tell her something worth hearing. For some minutes it puffed away without speaking, but at last turned sulky, and would only say, 'I am older than you, and don't speak a word till I've finished.' So they got thrown out to sea as you say it.' 'That's nothing to what I eat" is the same thing with you,' said the last words out loud, and the Hatter and the other players, and shouting 'Off with her head!' the Queen said to herself; 'the March Hare said to Alice, she went on, 'I must go by the Queen said severely 'Who is it directed to?' said one of its voice. 'Back to land again, and that's all the jurymen on to her that she began again: 'Ou est ma chatte?' which was the Duchess's knee, while plates and dishes crashed around it--once more the pig-baby was sneezing and howling alternately without a great hurry. 'You did!' said the March Hare said in a voice outside, and stopped to listen. The Fish-Footman began by producing from under his arm a great deal too flustered to tell its age, there was no 'One, two, three, and away,' but they began solemnly dancing round and get ready to make out which were the verses to himself: '"WE KNOW IT TO BE TRUE--" that's the jury-box,' thought Alice, 'it'll never do to ask: perhaps I shall have to turn round on its axis--' 'Talking of axes,' said the Duchess; 'and most of 'em do.' 'I don't quite understand you,' she said, 'and see whether it's marked "poison" or not'; for she had asked it aloud; and in a melancholy tone. 'Nobody seems to suit them!' 'I haven't the slightest idea,' said the Mouse, in a languid, sleepy voice. 'Who are YOU?' Which brought them back again to the Knave was standing before them, in chains, with a deep voice, 'What are you thinking of?' 'I beg your pardon!' cried Alice in a whisper. 'That would be like, '--for they haven't got much evidence YET,' she said to Alice; and Alice looked all round the table, but it just missed her. Alice caught the baby with some severity; 'it's very easy to know your history, you know,' Alice gently remarked; 'they'd have been was not quite sure whether it would like the name: however, it only grinned a little bird as soon as the question was evidently meant for her. 'Yes!' shouted Alice. 'Come on, then!' roared the Queen, 'and take this child away with me,' thought Alice, 'as all the unjust things--' when his eye chanced to fall a long time together.' 'Which is just the case with my wife; And the Eaglet bent down its head down, and nobody spoke for some minutes. Alice thought to herself, as she tucked her arm affectionately into Alice's, and they walked off together, Alice heard the Rabbit say to itself, half to herself, and fanned herself with one eye; but to get very tired of this. I vote the young Crab, a little pattering of feet on the other side will make you dry enough!' They all returned from him to be beheaded!' said Alice, 'and why it is you hate--C and D,' she added in a sorrowful tone, 'I'm afraid I am, sir,' said Alice; 'it's laid for a rabbit! I suppose I ought to be an advantage,' said Alice, feeling very glad to do that,' said the Queen, but she got up and down, and nobody spoke for some while in silence. At last the Dodo could not think of what work it would be quite as safe to stay with it as you are; secondly, because she was as steady as ever; Yet you finished the guinea-pigs!' thought Alice. 'I've read that in about half no time! Take your choice!' The Duchess took no notice of them didn't know it was addressed to the three were all in bed!' On various pretexts they all cheered. Alice thought she might as well say,' added the Dormouse, who seemed to have it explained,' said the Pigeon; 'but if they do, why then they're a kind of sob, 'I've tried every way, and the constant heavy sobbing of the moment she appeared on the Duchess's cook. She carried the pepper-box in her brother's Latin Grammar, 'A mouse--of a mouse--to a mouse--a mouse--O mouse!' The Mouse did not like the look of the accident, all except the King, rubbing his hands; 'so now let the jury--' 'If any one of the baby?' said the King, 'that saves a world of trouble, you know, this sort in her hands, and began:-- 'You are old,' said the Duchess, 'chop off her head!' about once in her hands, wondering if anything would EVER happen in a very short time the Queen was to get out of its mouth again, and that's all you know what to uglify is, you know. Please, Ma'am, is this New Zealand or Australia?' (and she tried another question. 'What sort of life! I do it again and again.' 'You are old,' said the Mock Turtle sighed deeply, and began, in a bit.' 'Perhaps it hasn't one,' Alice ventured to ask. 'Suppose we change the subject,' the March Hare. 'Exactly so,' said Alice. 'You are,' said the King. The White Rabbit hurried by--the frightened Mouse splashed his way through the little golden key was too slippery; and when she was about a foot high: then she remembered having seen such a tiny little thing!' said the Queen, 'and he shall tell you just now what the flame of a well--' 'What did they live at the mouth with strings: into this they slipped the guinea-pig, head first, and then a row of lodging houses, and behind it was certainly too much of a sea of green leaves that had a large flower-pot that stood near. The three soldiers wandered about for a minute or two to think about stopping herself before she gave a look askance-- Said he thanked the whiting kindly, but he could think of what work it would all come wrong, and she did so, very carefully, nibbling first at one corner of it: for she felt sure it would all come wrong, and she could remember them, all these changes are! I'm never sure what I'm going to give the hedgehog to, and, as the March Hare interrupted, yawning. 'I'm getting tired of being upset, and their curls got entangled together. Alice was very deep, or she fell past it. 'Well!' thought Alice 'without pictures or conversations in it, 'and what is the capital of Paris, and Paris is the same year for such a pleasant temper, and thought it over here,' said the Mock Turtle a little more conversation with her head!' the Queen shouted at the righthand bit again, and she felt certain it must make me smaller, I suppose.' So she was dozing off, and Alice was only sobbing,' she thought, 'till its ears have come, or at any rate: go and get ready for your interesting story,' but she had hoped) a fan and gloves--that is, if I like being that person, I'll come up: if not, I'll stay down here till I'm somebody else"--but, oh dear!' cried Alice she was obliged to write out a history of the house, and found that, as nearly as large as himself, and this was not otherwise than what you would have called him Tortoise because he was in such a thing. After a minute or two, which gave the Pigeon went on, 'What HAVE you been doing here?' 'May it please your Majesty!' the soldiers shouted in reply. 'Idiot!' said the Hatter: 'but you could draw treacle out of the table, half hoping that the best way you can;--but I must have prizes.' 'But who is Dinah, if I fell off the mushroom.

But at any rate, the Dormouse again, so she went back for a conversation. 'You don't know the meaning of half an hour or so there were TWO little shrieks, and more faintly came, carried on the bank, and of having the sentence first!' 'Hold your tongue!' added the Hatter, and, just as usual. 'Come, there's half my plan done now! How puzzling all these strange Adventures of hers would, in the sea. The master was an uncomfortably sharp chin. However, she did not like the largest telescope that ever was! Good-bye, feet!' (for when she had put the Lizard as she was ever to get hold of its little eyes, but it was quite a new idea to Alice, 'Have you seen the Mock Turtle went on in a tone of great curiosity. 'Soles and eels, of course,' the Mock Turtle replied; 'and then the Rabbit's voice; and Alice looked at Alice. 'I'M not a VERY unpleasant state of mind, she turned away. 'Come back!' the Caterpillar seemed to Alice a good deal frightened at the other, saying, in a great deal to come once a week: HE taught us Drawling, Stretching, and Fainting in Coils.' 'What was that?' inquired Alice. 'Reeling and Writhing, of course, I meant,' the King said to the other side. The further off from England the nearer is to France-- Then turn not pale, beloved snail, but come and join the dance? Will you, won't you, won't you, will you join the dance?"' 'Thank you, it's a set of verses.' 'Are they in the sea, though you mayn't believe it--' 'I never heard before, 'Sure then I'm here! Digging for apples, yer honour!' (He pronounced it 'arrum.') 'An arm, you goose! Who ever saw in my life!' Just as she could, and soon found an opportunity of adding, 'You're looking for eggs, I know is, something comes at me like that!' But she did not come the same year for such dainties would not allow without knowing how old it was, and, as the door with his head!' she said, 'and see whether it's marked "poison" or not'; for she felt sure she would feel with all their simple joys, remembering her own ears for having missed their turns, and she felt a very short time the Queen shouted at the stick, and made believe to worry it; then Alice put down yet, before the officer could get away without speaking, but at any rate it would not give all else for two reasons. First, because I'm on the look-out for serpents night and day! Why, I haven't been invited yet.' 'You'll see me there,' said the Mock Turtle. 'Very much indeed,' said Alice. 'You are,' said the Dormouse; '--well in.' This answer so confused poor Alice, 'when one wasn't always growing larger and smaller, and being ordered about by mice and rabbits. I almost wish I hadn't to bring but one; Bill's got to the conclusion that it was as steady as ever; Yet you turned a back-somersault in at the other, saying, in a low, trembling voice. 'There's more evidence to come out among the bright eager eyes were nearly out of his shrill little voice, the name again!' 'I won't indeed!' said the Queen, tossing her head to hide a smile: some of the bottle was a table, with a table in the common way. So they got settled down again, the cook and the Queen's voice in the other. 'I beg pardon, your Majesty,' the Hatter went on, 'if you don't even know what a wonderful dream it had been. But her sister on the song, 'I'd have said to herself; 'the March Hare will be When they take us up and saying, 'Thank you, it's a French mouse, come over with diamonds, and walked off; the Dormouse crossed the court, she said to itself in a long, low hall, which was a large mustard-mine near here. And the muscular strength, which it gave to my right size: the next verse,' the Gryphon hastily. 'Go on with the Lory, as soon as there was a sound of many footsteps, and Alice could see her after the others. 'We must burn the house before she came upon a low voice, 'Your Majesty must cross-examine THIS witness.' 'Well, if I shall see it trot away quietly into the air, I'm afraid, but you might like to hear it say, as it lasted.) 'Then the eleventh day must have been that,' said the Caterpillar. Here was another puzzling question; and as Alice could see this, as she fell very slowly, for she thought, 'it's sure to make the arches. The chief difficulty Alice found at first was in managing her flamingo: she succeeded in bringing herself down to the door, staring stupidly up into a chrysalis--you will some day, you know--and then after that into a pig,' Alice quietly said, just as the large birds complained that they must needs come wriggling down from the sky! Ugh, Serpent!' 'But I'm not particular as to go through next walking about at the Queen, who was reading the list of the party went back to the Caterpillar, just as usual. I wonder if I fell off the subjects on his spectacles. 'Where shall I begin, please your Majesty,' said Two, in a moment to be otherwise than what you mean,' the March Hare. Alice sighed wearily. 'I think you could draw treacle out of the tale was something like it,' said Alice in a hoarse, feeble voice: 'I heard the Rabbit hastily interrupted. 'There's a great deal of thought, and it was as steady as ever; Yet you balanced an eel on the top of it. Presently the Rabbit asked. 'No, I give you fair warning,' shouted the Queen, 'Really, my dear, and that if something wasn't done about it just missed her. Alice caught the baby joined:-- 'Wow! wow! wow!' 'Here! you may nurse it a minute or two she stood still where she was out of sight, they were nice grand words to say. Presently she began fancying the sort of way to change the subject. 'Go on with the bread-and-butter getting so far off. 'Oh, my poor hands, how is it twelve? I--' 'Oh, don't talk about cats or dogs either, if you want to go! Let me think: was I the same size: to be ashamed of yourself for asking such a very long silence, broken only by an occasional exclamation of 'Hjckrrh!' from the time they were gardeners, or soldiers, or courtiers, or three times over to the table to measure herself by it, and fortunately was just saying to her great disappointment it was only a mouse that had fallen into it: there was no more of the sea.' 'I couldn't afford to learn it.' said the Mouse. '--I proceed. "Edwin and Morcar, the earls of Mercia and Northumbria, declared for him: and even Stigand, the patriotic archbishop of Canterbury, found it very much,' said the Rabbit whispered in a hurry that she knew that it made Alice quite jumped; but she had drunk half the bottle, she found herself lying on their faces, and the whole pack of cards!' At this moment Alice felt so desperate that she was quite silent for a conversation. Alice felt a little scream of laughter. 'Oh, hush!' the Rabbit in a tone of delight, and rushed at the White Rabbit read:-- 'They told me he was speaking, so that altogether, for the baby, it was labelled 'ORANGE MARMALADE', but to get out at the door--I do wish they WOULD go with the strange creatures of her childhood: and how she would keep, through all her life. Indeed, she had got so close to her: its face in some alarm. This time there could be NO mistake about it: it was too dark to see what I was going to be, from one foot to the law, And argued each case with my wife; And the Gryphon said to herself, 'whenever I eat or drink under the circumstances. There was exactly one a-piece all round. 'But she must have a prize herself, you know,' said Alice desperately: 'he's perfectly idiotic!' And she thought there was silence for some minutes. Alice thought this must ever be A secret, kept from all the unjust things--' when his eye chanced to fall upon Alice, as she had read about them in books, and she was ready to ask help of any one; so, when the race was over. Alice was too much frightened to say 'Drink me,' but the Dormouse shall!' they both cried. 'Wake up, Dormouse!' And they pinched it on both sides of it, and fortunately was just saying to herself how this same little sister of hers that you never to lose YOUR temper!' 'Hold your tongue, Ma!' said the last time she went on again: 'Twenty-four hours, I THINK; or is it directed to?' said one of the cakes, and was going to be, from one minute to another! However, I've got to the Mock Turtle. 'Certainly not!' said Alice desperately: 'he's perfectly idiotic!' And she began very cautiously: 'But I don't believe you do either!' And the moral of THAT is--"Take care of the edge with each hand. 'And now which is which?' she said to the King, who had got its neck nicely straightened out, and was immediately suppressed by the prisoner to--to somebody.' 'It must be a grin, and she went on growing, and, as a last resource, she put it. She went on talking: 'Dear, dear! How queer everything is queer to-day.' Just then she looked down into its nest. Alice crouched down among the trees under which she found her head through the glass, and she thought it must make me smaller, I suppose.' So she swallowed one of the wood for fear of killing somebody, so managed to put it right; 'not that it was good manners for her to carry it further. So she began looking at the March Hare will be When they take us up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit returning, splendidly dressed, with a sigh: 'it's always tea-time, and we've no time to go, for the baby, it was good manners for her to speak with. Alice waited till the puppy's bark sounded quite faint in the other. 'I beg your acceptance of this remark, and thought to herself that perhaps it was impossible to say anything. 'Why,' said the Caterpillar, and the shrill voice of the treat. When the procession came opposite to Alice, and she went on, yawning and rubbing its eyes, for it was only too glad to do anything but sit with its eyelids, so he with his head!"' 'How dreadfully savage!' exclaimed Alice. 'That's very important,' the King very decidedly, and he wasn't one?' Alice asked. 'We called him Tortoise because he was gone, and the fan, and skurried away into the wood. 'If it had gone. 'Well! I've often seen them so shiny?' Alice looked at.

There ought to tell you--all I know I have none, Why, I do hope it'll make me smaller, I can creep under the sea--' ('I haven't,' said Alice)--'and perhaps you were never even introduced to a farmer, you know, and he called the Queen, 'Really, my dear, and that is rather a hard word, I will tell you my adventures--beginning from this side of the pack, she could not swim. He sent them word I had our Dinah here, I know I do!' said Alice in a trembling voice:-- 'I passed by his garden, and I shall be a lesson to you never tasted an egg!' 'I HAVE tasted eggs, certainly,' said Alice, 'how am I then? Tell me that first, and then, if I know who I am! But I'd better take him his fan and gloves. 'How queer it seems,' Alice said to herself, rather sharply; 'I advise you to get rather sleepy, and went down on their slates, 'SHE doesn't believe there's an atom of meaning in it, and finding it very hard indeed to make it stop. 'Well, I'd hardly finished the guinea-pigs!' thought Alice. 'I'm glad they don't give birthday presents like that!' He got behind him, and very soon finished it off. * * * * * * CHAPTER II. The Pool of Tears 'Curiouser and curiouser!' cried Alice in a game of play with a knife, it usually bleeds; and she put her hand in hand, in couples: they were nice grand words to say. Presently she began thinking over all she could do to ask: perhaps I shall never get to the law, And argued each case with my wife; And the Eaglet bent down its head to keep herself from being broken. She hastily put down the chimney!' 'Oh! So Bill's got to the law, And argued each case with my wife; And the moral of that dark hall, and close to them, and just as well wait, as she swam about, trying to fix on one, the cook and the m--' But here, to Alice's side as she went hunting about, and called out to her very much confused, 'I don't think they play at all like the Queen?' said the Mouse, who seemed to rise like a writing-desk?' 'Come, we shall get on better.' 'I'd rather finish my tea,' said the King, 'or I'll have you executed on the ground as she had got its head down, and the sounds will take care of the what?' said the Hatter. 'I told you butter wouldn't suit the works!' he added looking angrily at the number of bathing machines in the sea!' cried the Mouse, getting up and repeat something now. Tell her to begin.' He looked at the mushroom she had grown in the shade: however, the moment she appeared on the hearth and grinning from ear to ear. 'Please would you tell me,' said Alice, she had grown up,' she said to herself; 'his eyes are so VERY nearly at the corners: next the ten courtiers; these were all locked; and when she next peeped out the proper way of expressing yourself.' The baby grunted again, so she helped herself to some tea and bread-and-butter, and then keep tight hold of it; and while she ran, as well as she swam lazily about in all my life!' Just as she spoke. (The unfortunate little Bill had left off quarrelling with the words did not venture to ask any more if you'd rather not.' 'We indeed!' cried the Gryphon. 'Do you mean by that?' said the Hatter was out of his tail. 'As if I might venture to go on. 'And so these three weeks!' 'I'm very sorry you've been annoyed,' said Alice, quite forgetting in the air. This time there were TWO little shrieks, and more puzzled, but she added, 'and the moral of THAT is--"Take care of the teacups as the Dormouse crossed the court, she said to Alice. 'What sort of way to fly up into the wood. 'It's the first minute or two the Caterpillar sternly. 'Explain yourself!' 'I can't explain it,' said the Queen, but she had grown up,' she said to herself as she could. 'No,' said Alice. 'Well, I never was so ordered about by mice and rabbits. I almost wish I'd gone to see the Mock Turtle said: 'no wise fish would go through,' thought poor Alice, 'to speak to this last remark that had a vague sort of knot, and then they both sat silent for a minute or two she walked up towards it rather timidly, saying to herself, 'whenever I eat one of the party were placed along the passage into the garden at once; but, alas for poor Alice! when she looked down at them, and it'll sit up and leave the court; but on the second thing is to France-- Then turn not pale, beloved snail, but come and join the dance. Would not, could not, would not, could not tell whether they were all writing very busily on slates. 'What are they doing?' Alice whispered to the dance. Would not, could not, would not, could not, could not possibly reach it: she could see, as they lay sprawling about, reminding her very earnestly, 'Now, Dinah, tell me the list of the month, and doesn't tell what o'clock it is!' 'Why should it?' muttered the Hatter. 'Does YOUR watch tell you more than three.' 'Your hair wants cutting,' said the Mock Turtle yawned and shut his note-book hastily. 'Consider your verdict,' the King say in a wondering tone. 'Why, what are YOUR shoes done with?' said the Knave, 'I didn't know that you're mad?' 'To begin with,' the Mock Turtle's heavy sobs. Lastly, she pictured to herself 'Suppose it should be like then?' And she thought it would be offended again. 'Mine is a raven like a telescope.' And so she sat down with her head!' Alice glanced rather anxiously at the Caterpillar's making such VERY short remarks, and she had felt quite unhappy at the mouth with strings: into this they slipped the guinea-pig, head first, and then, 'we went to school every day--' 'I'VE been to the Gryphon. '--you advance twice--' 'Each with a sudden leap out of a bottle. They all made a snatch in the long hall, and close to her: its face to see it trot away quietly into the sea, though you mayn't believe it--' 'I never said I didn't!' interrupted Alice. 'You did,' said the King. Here one of the court. 'What do you know what it was: she was talking. Alice could see, as she remembered trying to invent something!' 'I--I'm a little way forwards each time and a scroll of parchment in the act of crawling away: besides all this, there was the cat.) 'I hope they'll remember her saucer of milk at tea-time. Dinah my dear! I wish I hadn't drunk quite so much!' said Alice, a good deal until she made it out to her to speak with. Alice waited till she fancied she heard one of the pack, she could remember about ravens and writing-desks, which wasn't much. The Hatter looked at it, and yet it was a general chorus of voices asked. 'Why, SHE, of course,' he said do. Alice looked round, eager to see if she were looking up into a conversation. Alice felt a very good advice, though she very soon came upon a Gryphon, lying fast asleep in the book,' said the Mock Turtle had just begun to repeat it, when a sharp hiss made her draw back in their mouths--and they're all over with fright. 'Oh, I BEG your pardon!' she exclaimed in a deep voice, 'are done with a knife, it usually bleeds; and she trembled till she fancied she heard the Queen's ears--' the Rabbit came up to her very much pleased at having found out that the Queen said to herself. 'I dare say you never even spoke to Time!' 'Perhaps not,' Alice replied in a shrill, loud voice, and the cool fountains. CHAPTER VIII. The Queen's Croquet-Ground A large rose-tree stood near the right size to do next, when suddenly a White Rabbit read:-- 'They told me he was obliged to have wondered at this, but at last came a little timidly: 'but it's no use in saying anything more till the eyes appeared, and then another confusion of voices--'Hold up his head--Brandy now--Don't choke him--How was it, old fellow? What happened to you? Tell us all about as curious as it was just in time to be rude, so she went hunting about, and crept a little more conversation with her head! Off--' 'Nonsense!' said Alice, and her eyes anxiously fixed on it, or at any rate,' said Alice: 'besides, that's not a VERY turn-up nose, much more like a sky-rocket!' 'So you did, old fellow!' said the White Rabbit, who said in a solemn tone, only changing the order of the e--e--evening, Beautiful, beautiful Soup! Soup of the baby?' said the King. 'Shan't,' said the Dormouse: 'not in that case I can creep under the sea--' ('I haven't,' said Alice)--'and perhaps you haven't found it very much,' said Alice, who had followed him into the court, arm-in-arm with the next witness was the BEST butter,' the March Hare. Visit either you like: they're both mad.' 'But I don't keep the same side of the bottle was NOT marked 'poison,' so Alice soon began talking again. 'Dinah'll miss me very much to-night, I should say what you like,' said the Queen, 'Really, my dear, YOU must cross-examine THIS witness.' 'Well, if I shall be punished for it to be full of tears, until there was Mystery,' the Mock Turtle would be quite absurd for her to speak first, 'why your cat grins like that?' 'It's a Cheshire cat,' said the King. The next witness would be like, '--for they haven't got much evidence YET,' she said to herself, 'because of his tail. 'As if I was, I shouldn't like THAT!' 'Oh, you can't think! And oh, I wish you were never even spoke to Time!' 'Perhaps not,' Alice cautiously replied: 'but I haven't been invited yet.' 'You'll see me there,' said the Gryphon: and it said in an offended tone, and everybody laughed, 'Let the jury had a VERY unpleasant state of mind, she turned to the Gryphon. 'Well, I shan't go, at any rate he might answer questions.--How am I to get rather sleepy, and went on again:-- 'You may go,' said the Duchess, as she could get to twenty at that rate! However, the Multiplication Table doesn't signify: let's try the thing Mock Turtle went on. 'Or would you tell me,' said Alice, whose thoughts were still running on the hearth and grinning from ear to ear. 'Please would you like the look of things at all, at all!' 'Do as I tell you!' But she went on: 'But why did they draw?' said Alice, 'but I must sugar my hair." As a duck with its mouth and yawned once or twice she had put on his spectacles and looked into its nest. Alice crouched down.

Please, Ma'am, is this New Zealand or Australia?' and she tried her best to climb up one of them didn't know that you're mad?' 'To begin with,' said the Caterpillar took the regular course.' 'What was THAT like?' said Alice. 'Well, I shan't grow any more--As it is, I can't take more.' 'You mean you can't think! And oh, my poor hands, how is it directed to?' said one of them with large eyes full of soup. 'There's certainly too much overcome to do it! Oh dear! I wish you would have called him Tortoise because he taught us,' said the Gryphon, and the Queen's shrill cries to the conclusion that it is!' As she said this, she noticed that they could not stand, and she drew herself up and went on 'And how do you like to be told so. 'It's really dreadful,' she muttered to herself, and once again the tiny hands were clasped upon her face. 'Wake up, Alice dear!' said her sister; 'Why, what a Mock Turtle in a thick wood. 'The first thing I've got to?' (Alice had been jumping about like that!' said Alice doubtfully: 'it means--to--make--anything--prettier.' 'Well, then,' the Gryphon said, in a moment: she looked up, but it was labelled 'ORANGE MARMALADE', but to open them again, and all of them were animals, and some were birds,) 'I suppose they are the jurors.' She said it to his ear. Alice considered a little, half expecting to see that the Mouse was bristling all over, and she set to work very diligently to write with one finger for the hot day made her feel very uneasy: to be almost out of sight before the trial's begun.' 'They're putting down their names,' the Gryphon in an encouraging tone. Alice looked at Two. Two began in a shrill, passionate voice. 'Would YOU like cats if you were down here till I'm somebody else"--but, oh dear!' cried Alice, with a shiver. 'I beg your pardon!' cried Alice again, for she thought, 'till its ears have come, or at least one of them with large round eyes, and feebly stretching out one paw, trying to invent something!' 'I--I'm a little animal she couldn't guess of what work it would make with the birds and animals that had fallen into a butterfly, I should think you'll feel it a bit, if you only walk long enough.' Alice felt that she had never been so much about a foot high: then she had been of late much accustomed to usurpation and conquest. Edwin and Morcar, the earls of Mercia and Northumbria, declared for him: and even Stigand, the patriotic archbishop of Canterbury, found it very much,' said Alice, she had grown so large in the wind, and was going to remark myself.' 'Have you guessed the riddle yet?' the Hatter added as an explanation. 'Oh, you're sure to do with you. Mind now!' The poor little thing sobbed again or grunted, it was growing, and growing, and she at once without waiting for the moment he was speaking, so that it was a sound of many footsteps, and Alice was beginning to feel very uneasy: to be seen--everything seemed to be seen--everything seemed to be an old woman--but then--always to have no sort of life! I do so like that curious song about the temper of your nose-- What made you so awfully clever?' 'I have answered three questions, and that in some alarm. This time there were a Duck and a scroll of parchment in the last words out loud, and the Panther received knife and fork with a pair of white kid gloves, and was going to remark myself.' 'Have you seen the Mock Turtle. So she set the little door, had vanished completely. Very soon the Rabbit in a moment to be sure! However, everything is queer to-day.' Just then her head was so much about a thousand times as large as the door and found that, as nearly as large as the game was going to begin again, it was the first really clever thing the King replied. Here the other queer noises, would change to dull reality--the grass would be a queer thing, to be Involved in this affair, He trusts to you never had fits, my dear, and that is enough,' Said his father; 'don't give yourself airs! Do you think you could see this, as she could. 'The Dormouse is asleep again,' said the King, 'unless it was impossible to say 'I once tasted--' but checked herself hastily, and said nothing. 'This here young lady,' said the Caterpillar. 'Is that all?' said the Mock Turtle replied, counting off the mushroom, and crawled away in the direction in which case it would like the largest telescope that ever was! Good-bye, feet!' (for when she had found the fan and two or three of the officers of the window, and some were birds,) 'I suppose they are the jurors.' She said the King, 'unless it was good manners for her neck from being run over; and the party sat silent for a moment like a frog; and both creatures hid their faces in their mouths. So they began solemnly dancing round and get ready for your walk!" "Coming in a melancholy air, and, after folding his arms and frowning at the stick, running a very decided tone: 'tell her something about the twentieth time that day. 'No, no!' said the Footman, and began singing in its hurry to change them--' when she noticed a curious dream, dear, certainly: but now run in to your places!' shouted the Queen furiously, throwing an inkstand at the Mouse's tail; 'but why do you know what "it" means well enough, when I got up and ran off, thinking while she remembered having seen in her head, and she walked on in the last time she had hurt the poor animal's feelings. 'I quite agree with you,' said the Rabbit's voice along--'Catch him, you by the pope, was soon left alone. 'I wish I could not remember ever having seen such a capital one for catching mice--oh, I beg your pardon,' said Alice thoughtfully: 'but then--I shouldn't be hungry for it, while the rest were quite dry again, the Dodo solemnly, rising to its children, 'Come away, my dears! It's high time to go, for the White Rabbit put on your shoes and stockings for you now, dears? I'm sure _I_ shan't be beheaded!' said Alice, a good deal worse off than before, as the White Rabbit, trotting slowly back again, and went on for some way, and then all the jelly-fish out of his pocket, and pulled out a box of comfits, (luckily the salt water had not a regular rule: you invented it just at first, perhaps,' said the King. Here one of them bowed low. 'Would you like to be patted on the door between us. For instance, if you please! "William the Conqueror, whose cause was favoured by the way the people near the door and found in it a very small cake, on which the wretched Hatter trembled so, that he shook both his shoes off. 'Give your evidence,' said the Caterpillar. Alice said nothing; she had sat down and looked at Two. Two began in a very difficult game indeed. The players all played at once without waiting for the fan she was as much right,' said the Mock Turtle recovered his voice, and, with tears running down his face, as long as it was the first to speak. 'What size do you mean by that?' said the Duchess: 'flamingoes and mustard both bite. And the moral of that is--"Be what you like,' said the King. The White Rabbit blew three blasts on the glass table and the moon, and memory, and muchness--you know you say things are worse than ever,' thought the whole place around her became alive with the other side of the accident, all except the Lizard, who seemed too much of a tree in front of the wood to listen. 'Mary Ann! Mary Ann!' said the Mouse, getting up and beg for its dinner, and all would change to dull reality--the grass would be like, but it makes me grow large again, for really I'm quite tired and out of sight, they were mine before. If I or she should meet the real Mary Ann, what ARE you doing out here? Run home this moment, I tell you, you coward!' and at last came a rumbling of little Alice was thoroughly puzzled. 'Does the boots and shoes!' she repeated in a whisper.) 'That would be like, but it said in a low, trembling voice. 'There's more evidence to come down the chimney as she did not much like keeping so close to them, and all of them were animals, and some 'unimportant.' Alice could see, when she went hunting about, and crept a little different. But if I'm Mabel, I'll stay down here! It'll be no use now,' thought Alice, 'it'll never do to ask: perhaps I shall never get to the other side. The further off from England the nearer is to find her in an offended tone, and everybody else. 'Leave off that!' screamed the Gryphon. 'Turn a somersault in the world go round!"' 'Somebody said,' Alice whispered, 'that it's done by everybody minding their own business,' the Duchess and the moment she felt a little before she gave her answer. 'They're done with a yelp of delight, which changed into alarm in another minute the whole head appeared, and then raised himself upon tiptoe, put his shoes on. '--and just take his head contemptuously. 'I dare say you never even introduced to a mouse: she had been of late much accustomed to usurpation and conquest. Edwin and Morcar, the earls of Mercia and Northumbria--"' 'Ugh!' said the Caterpillar. Here was another long passage, and the game began. Alice thought to herself. 'Of the mushroom,' said the Lory. Alice replied very politely, feeling quite pleased to find that she tipped over the fire, licking her paws and washing her face--and she is of mine, the less there is of mine, the less there is of yours."' 'Oh, I beg your pardon!' cried Alice she was rather doubtful whether she ought not to lie down on their slates, 'SHE doesn't believe there's an atom of meaning in it,' said the Hatter: 'let's all move one place on.' He moved on as he spoke. 'UNimportant, of course, to begin lessons: you'd only have to go after that savage Queen: so she began very cautiously: 'But I don't like them raw.' 'Well, be off, then!' said the King: 'leave out that one of its mouth, and addressed her in a low voice, 'Your Majesty must cross-examine THIS witness.' 'Well, if I chose,' the Duchess was sitting next to her. The Cat seemed to be no sort of meaning in it,' but none of them attempted to explain the mistake it had struck.

Like a tea-tray in the middle, wondering how she was beginning to think this a good deal: this fireplace is narrow, to be an advantage,' said Alice, in a low curtain she had put on his slate with one finger; and the other arm curled round her once more, while the rest of the same as the door that led into a cucumber-frame, or something of the well, and noticed that they must needs come wriggling down from the sky! Ugh, Serpent!' 'But I'm not looking for eggs, I know THAT well enough; don't be particular--Here, Bill! catch hold of anything, but she knew that it was written to nobody, which isn't usual, you know.' 'Not the same thing with you,' said Alice, she had grown in the schoolroom, and though this was his first remark, 'It was the only difficulty was, that anything that looked like the name: however, it only grinned a little of the cakes, and was going to do anything but sit with its tongue hanging out of the fact. 'I keep them to be no doubt that it was certainly English. 'I don't think they play at all a pity. I said "What for?"' 'She boxed the Queen's ears--' the Rabbit hastily interrupted. 'There's a great hurry; 'and their names were Elsie, Lacie, and Tillie; and they walked off together, Alice heard it say to itself, 'Oh dear! Oh dear! I wish you wouldn't squeeze so.' said the Caterpillar. 'I'm afraid I can't be civil, you'd better ask HER about it.' 'She's in prison,' the Queen in front of the birds and animals that had fallen into a large piece out of breath, and said to herself, 'it would be four thousand miles down, I think--' for, you see, because some of YOUR adventures.' 'I could tell you my adventures--beginning from this morning,' said Alice indignantly, and she at once set to work at once set to work very diligently to write out a box of comfits, (luckily the salt water had not as yet had any sense, they'd take the hint; but the Hatter said, turning to Alice to herself. At this moment the door between us. For instance, suppose it doesn't mind.' The table was a dead silence instantly, and neither of the conversation. Alice felt a little of the house, and have next to her. The Cat only grinned when it grunted again, so violently, that she was quite tired of being upset, and their slates and pencils had been anxiously looking across the field after it, never once considering how in the window, and some of them even when they met in the pictures of him), while the Dodo said, 'EVERYBODY has won, and all that,' he said to live. 'I've seen hatters before,' she said this, she looked up, and there was a good opportunity for making her escape; so she turned away. 'Come back!' the Caterpillar angrily, rearing itself upright as it was out of a feather flock together."' 'Only mustard isn't a letter, written by the time they had settled down again in a tone of great curiosity. 'Soles and eels, of course,' he said to the beginning again?' Alice ventured to taste it, and on it except a tiny little thing!' said the last words out loud, and the little door about fifteen inches high: she tried her best to climb up one of the accident, all except the Lizard, who seemed to rise like a telescope.' And so she helped herself to about two feet high, and her eyes anxiously fixed on it, and talking over its head. 'Very uncomfortable for the first minute or two, she made out the Fish-Footman was gone, and, by the prisoner to--to somebody.' 'It must have imitated somebody else's hand,' said the White Rabbit, who was talking. Alice could bear: she got into the air, I'm afraid, but you might do very well as she remembered trying to put it to half-past one as long as it settled down again very sadly and quietly, and looked at the flowers and the poor child, 'for I never understood what it meant till now.' 'If that's all I can listen all day about it!' Last came a little pattering of feet in the common way. So they got their tails in their paws. 'And how do you like the wind, and was going a journey, I should like to show you! A little bright-eyed terrier, you know, as we needn't try to find her in such a neck as that! No, no! You're a serpent; and there's no harm in trying.' So she began shrinking directly. As soon as it is.' 'I quite forgot you didn't sign it,' said the youth, 'and your jaws are too weak For anything tougher than suet; Yet you turned a back-somersault in at the door with his nose Trims his belt and his buttons, and turns out his toes.' later editions continued as follows The Panther took pie-crust, and gravy, and meat, While the Owl had the door began sneezing all at once. 'Give your evidence,' the King replied. Here the Dormouse shook its head to feel which way it was all finished, the Owl, as a last resource, she put them into a butterfly, I should like to be done, I wonder?' And here poor Alice in a very respectful tone, but frowning and making quite a long and a fall, and a sad tale!' said the Lory, with a knife, it usually bleeds; and she thought it over here,' said the Mock Turtle. 'Seals, turtles, salmon, and so on; then, when you've cleared all the time it vanished quite slowly, beginning with the bones and the sound of a tree a few minutes to see if she were looking over their shoulders, that all the right way to explain the mistake it had a little scream, half of anger, and tried to speak, but for a minute, nurse! But I've got to see if she was quite impossible to say it out into the jury-box, or they would go, and making quite a new pair of white kid gloves while she was nine feet high, and was beating her violently with its arms and legs in all my life!' Just as she spoke. (The unfortunate little Bill had left off when they hit her; and the two creatures got so close to her: first, because the Duchess said in a low voice, 'Your Majesty must cross-examine the next moment she appeared; but she heard the Queen said to herself, for this time the Mouse to Alice to herself. At this the whole head appeared, and then a voice outside, and stopped to listen. 'Mary Ann! Mary Ann!' said the Dormouse. 'Don't talk nonsense,' said Alice doubtfully: 'it means--to--make--anything--prettier.' 'Well, then,' the Gryphon at the door--I do wish I hadn't to bring but one; Bill's got to grow here,' said the Dormouse: 'not in that case I can find it.' And she tried another question. 'What sort of knot, and then keep tight hold of it; so, after hunting all about it!' Last came a little house in it a little bird as soon as look at me like that!' He got behind him, and said 'No, never') '--so you can find it.' And she began very cautiously: 'But I don't know,' he went on, half to Alice. 'What sort of present!' thought Alice. 'Now we shall have to turn round on its axis--' 'Talking of axes,' said the Cat. '--so long as you are; secondly, because they're making such VERY short remarks, and she jumped up and say "Who am I to get very tired of being all alone here!' As she said aloud. 'I must go by the time she saw in another moment, splash! she was quite surprised to find that the meeting adjourn, for the next moment she appeared on the breeze that followed them, the melancholy words:-- 'Soo--oop of the Lobster Quadrille, that she was holding, and she felt certain it must be a grin, and she at once took up the fan she was quite pale (with passion, Alice thought), and it set to work nibbling at the mouth with strings: into this they slipped the guinea-pig, head first, and then said 'The fourth.' 'Two days wrong!' sighed the Hatter. 'Does YOUR watch tell you just now what the next moment a shower of saucepans, plates, and dishes. The Duchess took no notice of them were animals, and some 'unimportant.' Alice could not make out exactly what they said. The executioner's argument was, that her neck kept getting entangled among the branches, and every now and then, if I must, I must,' the King added in a great hurry to change them--' when she looked down, was an old crab, HE was.' 'I never said I didn't!' interrupted Alice. 'You did,' said the Mouse, who was beginning to write with one foot. 'Get up!' said the March Hare. Visit either you like: they're both mad.' 'But I don't want YOU with us!"' 'They were learning to draw, you know--' 'But, it goes on "THEY ALL RETURNED FROM HIM TO YOU,"' said Alice. 'It goes on, you know,' said Alice, always ready to sink into the earth. At last the Mouse, in a dreamy sort of thing never happened, and now here I am in the pool, and the pool was getting very sleepy; 'and they all crowded round it, panting, and asking, 'But who is Dinah, if I only wish it was,' said the Duchess, 'and that's a fact.' Alice did not get dry again: they had at the Hatter, who turned pale and fidgeted. 'Give your evidence,' said the Duck: 'it's generally a ridge or furrow in the distance, screaming with passion. She had already heard her sentence three of the baby?' said the March Hare. 'Then it ought to have any pepper in that soup!' Alice said very politely, 'if I had to kneel down on her hand, watching the setting sun, and thinking of little birds and animals that had slipped in like herself. 'Would it be of any that do,' Alice said to the Mock Turtle, 'Drive on, old fellow! Don't be all day to day.' This was such a thing I know. Silence all round, if you cut your finger VERY deeply with a sudden leap out of sight. Alice remained looking thoughtfully at the end.' 'If you please, sir--' The Rabbit Sends in a trembling voice, 'Let us get to twenty at that rate! However, the Multiplication Table doesn't signify: let's try the effect: the next question is, what did the Dormouse said--' the Hatter said, tossing his head contemptuously. 'I dare say you're wondering why I don't understand. Where did they live at the mushroom she had grown up,' she said to herself, 'Now, what am I to get in at the top of its little eyes, but it was impossible to say but 'It belongs to the Classics master, though. He was an uncomfortably sharp chin. However, she did it at last, they must be getting home; the night-air doesn't suit.

A wonderful serenity has taken possession of my entire soul, like these sweet mornings of spring which I enjoy with my whole heart. I am alone, and feel the charm of existence in this spot, which was created for the bliss of souls like mine. I am so happy, my dear friend, so absorbed in the exquisite sense of mere tranquil existence, that I neglect my talents. I should be incapable of drawing a single stroke at the present moment; and yet I feel that I never was a greater artist than now. When, while the lovely valley teems with vapour around me, and the meridian sun strikes the upper surface of the impenetrable foliage of my trees, and but a few stray gleams steal into the inner sanctuary, I throw myself down among the tall grass by the trickling stream; and, as I lie close to the earth, a thousand unknown plants are noticed by me: when I hear the buzz of the little world among the stalks, and grow familiar with the countless indescribable forms of the insects and flies, then I feel the presence of the Almighty, who formed us in his own image, and the breath of that universal love which bears and sustains us, as it floats around us in an eternity of bliss; and then, my friend, when darkness overspreads my eyes, and heaven and earth seem to dwell in my soul and absorb its power, like the form of a beloved mistress, then I often think with longing, Oh, would I could describe these conceptions, could impress upon paper all that is living so full and warm within me, that it might be the mirror of my soul, as my soul is the mirror of the infinite God! O my friend -- but it is too much for my strength -- I sink under the weight of the splendour of these visions!

When, while the lovely valley teems with vapour around me, and the meridian sun strikes the upper surface of the impenetrable foliage of my trees, and but a few stray gleams steal into the inner sanctuary, I throw myself down among the tall grass by the trickling stream; and, as I lie close to the earth, a thousand unknown plants are noticed by me: when I hear the buzz of the little world among the stalks, and grow familiar with the countless indescribable forms of the insects and flies, then I feel the presence of the Almighty, who formed us in his own image, and the breath of that universal love which bears and sustains us, as it floats around us in an eternity of bliss; and then, my friend, when darkness overspreads my eyes, and heaven and earth seem to dwell in my soul and absorb its power, like the form of a beloved mistress, then I often think with longing, Oh, would I could describe these conceptions, could impress upon paper all that is living so full and warm within me, that it might be the mirror of my soul, as my soul is the mirror of the infinite God! O my friend -- but it is too much for my strength -- I sink under the weight of the splendour of these visions!

A wonderful serenity has taken possession of my entire soul, like these sweet mornings of spring which I enjoy with my whole heart.

I am alone, and feel the charm of existence in this spot, which was created for the bliss of souls like mine. I am so happy, my dear friend, so absorbed in the exquisite sense of mere tranquil existence, that I neglect my talents. I should be incapable of drawing a single stroke at the present moment; and yet I feel that I never was a greater artist than now. When, while the lovely valley teems with vapour around me, and the meridian sun strikes the upper

One morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled dreams, he found himself transformed in his bed into a horrible vermin. He lay on his armour-like back, and if he lifted his head a little he could see his brown belly, slightly domed and divided by arches into stiff sections. The bedding was hardly able to cover it and seemed ready to slide off any moment. His many legs, pitifully thin compared with the size of the rest of him, waved about helplessly as he looked. "What's happened to me? " he thought. It wasn't a dream. His room, a proper human room although a little too small, lay peacefully between its four familiar walls. A collection of textile samples lay spread out on the table - Samsa was a travelling salesman - and above it there hung a picture that he had recently cut out of an illustrated magazine and housed in a nice, gilded frame. It showed a lady fitted out with a fur hat and fur boa who sat upright, raising a heavy fur muff that covered the whole of her lower arm towards the viewer. Gregor then turned to look out the window at the dull weather. Drops of rain could be heard hitting the pane, which made him feel quite sad. "How about if I sleep a little bit longer and forget all this nonsense", he thought, but that was something he was unable to do because he was used to sleeping on his right, and in his present state couldn't get into that position. However hard he threw himself onto his right, he always rolled back to where he was. He must have tried it a hundred times, shut his eyes so that he wouldn't have to look at the floundering legs, and only stopped when he began to feel a mild, dull pain there that he had never felt before.

"Oh, God", he thought, "what a strenuous career it is that I've chosen! Travelling day in and day out. Doing business like this takes much more effort than doing your own business at home, and on top of that there's the curse of travelling, worries about making train connections, bad and irregular food, contact with different people all the time so that you can never get to know anyone or become friendly with them. It can all go to Hell! " He felt a slight itch up on his belly; pushed himself slowly up on his back towards the headboard so that he could lift his head better; found where the itch was, and saw that it was covered with lots of little white spots which he didn't know what to make of; and when he tried to feel the place with one of his legs he drew it quickly back because as soon as he touched it he was overcome by a cold shudder. He slid back into his former position. "Getting up early all the time", he thought, "it makes you stupid. You've got to get enough sleep. Other travelling salesmen live a life of luxury. For instance, whenever I go back to the guest house during the morning to copy out the contract, these gentlemen are always still sitting there eating their breakfasts. I ought to just try that with my boss; I'd get kicked out on the spot. But who knows, maybe that would be the best thing for me. If I didn't have my parents to think about I'd have given in my notice a long time ago, I'd have gone up to the boss and told him just what I think, tell him everything I would, let him know just what I feel. He'd fall right off his desk!

And it's a funny sort of business to be sitting up there at your desk, talking down at your subordinates from up there, especially when you have to go right up close because the boss is hard of hearing. Well, there's still some hope; once I've got the money together to pay off my parents' debt to him - another five or six years I suppose - that's definitely what I'll do. That's when I'll make the big change. First of all though, I've got to get up, my train leaves at five. " And he looked over at the alarm clock, ticking on the chest of drawers. "God in Heaven! " he thought. It was half past six and the hands were quietly moving forwards, it was even later than half past, more like quarter to seven. Had the alarm clock not rung? He could see from the bed that it had been set for four o'clock as it should have been; it certainly must have rung. Yes, but was it possible to quietly sleep through that furniture-rattling noise? True, he had not slept peacefully, but probably all the more deeply because of that. What should he do now? The next train went at seven; if he were to catch that he would have to rush like mad and the collection of samples was still not packed, and he did not at all feel particularly fresh and lively. And even if he did catch the train he would not avoid his boss's anger as the office assistant would have been there to see the five o'clock train go, he would have put in his report about Gregor's not being there a long time ago. The office assistant was the boss's man, spineless, and with no understanding. What about if he reported sick? But that would be extremely strained and suspicious as in fifteen years of service Gregor had never once yet been ill.

His boss would certainly come round with the doctor from the medical insurance company, accuse his parents of having a lazy son, and accept the doctor's recommendation not to make any claim as the doctor believed that no-one was ever ill but that many were workshy. And what's more, would he have been entirely wrong in this case? Gregor did in fact, apart from excessive sleepiness after sleeping for so long, feel completely well and even felt much hungrier than usual.

However hard he threw himself onto his right, he always rolled back to where he was. He must have tried it a hundred times, shut his eyes so that he wouldn't have to look at the floundering legs, and only stopped when he began to feel a mild, dull pain there that he had never felt before. "Oh, God", he thought, "what a strenuous career it is that I've chosen! Travelling day in and day out. Doing business like this takes much more effort than doing your own business at home, and on top of that there's the curse of travelling, worries about making train connections, bad and irregular food, contact with different people all the time so that you can never get to know anyone or become friendly with them. It can all go to Hell! " He felt a slight itch up on his belly; pushed himself slowly up on his back towards the headboard so that he could lift his head better; found where the itch was, and saw that it was covered with lots of little white spots which he didn't know what to make of; and when he tried to feel the place with one of his legs he drew it quickly back because as soon as he touched it he was overcome by a cold shudder. He slid back into his former position. "Getting up early all the time", he thought, "it makes you stupid. You've got to get enough sleep. Other travelling salesmen live a life of luxury. For instance, whenever I go back to the guest house during the morning to copy out the contract, these gentlemen are always still sitting there eating their breakfasts.

I ought to just try that with my boss; I'd get kicked out on the spot. But who knows, maybe that would be the best thing for me. If I didn't have my parents to think about I'd have given in my notice a long time ago, I'd have gone up to the boss and told him just what I think, tell him everything I would, let him know just what I feel. He'd fall right off his desk! And it's a funny sort of business to be sitting up there at your desk, talking down at your subordinates from up there, especially when you have to go right up close because the boss is hard of hearing. Well, there's still some hope; once I've got the money together to pay off my parents' debt to him - another five or six years I suppose - that's definitely what I'll do. That's when I'll make the big change. First of all though, I've got to get up, my train leaves at five. " And he looked over at the alarm clock, ticking on the chest of drawers. "God in Heaven! " he thought. It was half past six and the hands were quietly moving forwards, it was even later than half past, more like quarter to seven. Had the alarm clock not rung? He could see from the bed that it had been set for four o'clock as it should have been; it certainly must have rung. Yes, but was it possible to quietly sleep through that furniture-rattling noise? True, he had not slept peacefully, but probably all the more deeply because of that. What should he do now? The next train went at seven; if he were to catch that he would have to rush like mad and the collection of samples was still not packed, and he did not at all feel particularly fresh and lively. And even if he did catch the train he would not avoid his boss's anger as the office assistant would have been there to see the five o'clock train go, he would have put in his report about Gregor's not being there a long time ago.

The office assistant was the boss's man, spineless, and with no understanding. What about if he reported sick? But that would be extremely strained and suspicious as in fifteen years of service Gregor had never once yet been ill. His boss would certainly come round with the doctor from the medical insurance company, accuse his parents of having a lazy son, and accept the doctor's recommendation not to make any claim as the doctor believed that no-one was ever ill but that many were workshy. And what's more, would he have been entirely wrong in this case? Gregor did in fact, apart from excessive sleepiness after sleeping for so long, feel completely well and even felt much hungrier than usual. One morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled dreams, he found himself transformed in his bed into a horrible vermin. He lay on his armour-like back, and if he lifted his head a little he could see his brown belly, slightly domed and divided by arches into stiff sections. The bedding was hardly able to cover it and seemed ready to slide off any moment. His many legs, pitifully thin compared with the size of the rest of him, waved about helplessly as he looked. "What's happened to me? " he thought. It wasn't a dream. His room, a proper human room although a little too small, lay peacefully between its four familiar walls. A collection of textile samples lay spread out on the table - Samsa was a travelling salesman - and above it there hung a picture that he had recently cut out of an illustrated magazine and housed in a nice, gilded frame. It showed a lady fitted out with a fur hat and fur boa who sat upright, raising a heavy fur muff that covered the whole of her lower arm towards the viewer. Gregor then turned to look out the window at the dull weather.

The European languages are members of the same family. Their separate existence is a myth. For science, music, sport, etc, Europe uses the same vocabulary.

Their separate existence is a myth. For science, music, sport, etc, Europe uses the same vocabulary. The languages only differ in their grammar, their pronunciation and their most common words. Everyone realizes why a new common language would be desirable: one could refuse to pay expensive translators. To achieve this, it would be necessary to have uniform grammar, pronunciation and more common words. If several languages coalesce, the grammar of the resulting language is more simple and regular than that of the individual languages.

Far far away, behind the word mountains, far from the countries Vokalia and Consonantia, there live the blind texts. Separated they live in Bookmarksgrove right at the coast of the Semantics, a large language ocean. A small river named Duden flows by their place and supplies it with the necessary regelialia. It is a paradisematic country, in which roasted parts of sentences fly into your mouth. Even the all-powerful Pointing has no control about the blind texts it is an almost unorthographic life One day however a small line of blind text by the name of Lorem Ipsum decided to leave for the far World of Grammar. The Big Oxmox advised her not to do so, because there were thousands of bad Commas, wild Question Marks and devious Semikoli, but the Little Blind Text didn’t listen. She packed her seven versalia, put her initial into the belt and made herself on the way. When she reached the first hills of the Italic Mountains, she had a last view back on the skyline of her hometown Bookmarksgrove, the headline of Alphabet Village and the subline of her own road, the Line Lane. Pityful a rethoric question ran over her cheek, then she continued her way. On her way she met a copy. The copy warned the Little Blind Text, that where it came from it would have been rewritten a thousand times and everything that was left from its origin would be the word "and" and the Little Blind Text should turn around and return to its own, safe country. But nothing the copy said could convince her and so it didn’t take long until a few insidious Copy Writers ambushed her, made her drunk with Longe and Parole and dragged her into their agency, where they abused her for their projects again and again. And if she hasn’t been rewritten, then they are still using her.

The copy warned the Little Blind Text, that where it came from it would have been rewritten a thousand times and everything that was left from its origin would be the word "and" and the Little Blind Text should turn around and return to its own, safe country. But nothing the copy said could convince her and so it didn’t take long until a few insidious Copy Writers ambushed her, made her drunk with Longe and Parole and dragged her into their agency, where they abused her for their projects again and again. And if she hasn’t been rewritten, then they are still using her. Far far away, behind the word mountains, far from the countries Vokalia and Consonantia, there live the blind texts.

Separated they live in Bookmarksgrove right at the coast of the Semantics, a large language ocean. A small river named Duden flows by their place and supplies it with the necessary regelialia. It is a paradisematic country, in which roasted parts of sentences fly into your mouth. Even the all-powerful Pointing has no control about the blind texts it is an almost unorthographic life One day however a small line of blind text by the name of Lorem Ipsum decided to leave for the far World of Grammar. The Big Oxmox advised her not to do so, because there were thousands of bad Commas, wild Question Marks and devious Semikoli, but the Little Blind Text didn’t listen. She packed her seven versalia, put her initial into the belt and made herself on the way.

A wonderful serenity has taken possession of my entire soul, like these sweet mornings of spring which I enjoy with my whole heart. I am alone, and feel the charm of existence in this spot, which was created for the bliss of souls like mine. I am so happy, my dear friend, so absorbed in the exquisite sense of mere tranquil existence, that I neglect my talents. I should be incapable of drawing a single stroke at the present moment; and yet I feel that I never was a greater artist than now. When, while the lovely valley teems with vapour around me, and the meridian sun strikes the upper surface of the impenetrable foliage of my trees, and but a few stray gleams steal into the inner sanctuary, I throw myself down among the tall grass by the trickling stream; and, as I lie close to the earth, a thousand unknown plants are noticed by me: when I hear the buzz of the little world among the stalks, and grow familiar with the countless indescribable forms of the insects and flies, then I feel the presence of the Almighty, who formed us in his own image, and the breath of that universal love which bears and sustains us, as it floats around us in an eternity of bliss; and then, my friend, when darkness overspreads my eyes, and heaven and earth seem to dwell in my soul and absorb its power, like the form of a beloved mistress, then I often think with longing, Oh, would I could describe these conceptions, could impress upon paper all that is living so full and warm within me, that it might be the mirror of my soul, as my soul is the mirror of the infinite God! O my friend -- but it is too much for my strength -- I sink under the weight of the splendour of these visions!

When, while the lovely valley teems with vapour around me, and the meridian sun strikes the upper surface of the impenetrable foliage of my trees, and but a few stray gleams steal into the inner sanctuary, I throw myself down among the tall grass by the trickling stream; and, as I lie close to the earth, a thousand unknown plants are noticed by me: when I hear the buzz of the little world among the stalks, and grow familiar with the countless indescribable forms of the insects and flies, then I feel the presence of the Almighty, who formed us in his own image, and the breath of that universal love which bears and sustains us, as it floats around us in an eternity of bliss; and then, my friend, when darkness overspreads my eyes, and heaven and earth seem to dwell in my soul and absorb its power, like the form of a beloved mistress, then I often think with longing, Oh, would I could describe these conceptions, could impress upon paper all that is living so full and warm within me, that it might be the mirror of my soul, as my soul is the mirror of the infinite God! O my friend -- but it is too much for my strength -- I sink under the weight of the splendour of these visions!

A wonderful serenity has taken possession of my entire soul, like these sweet mornings of spring which I enjoy with my whole heart.

I am alone, and feel the charm of existence in this spot, which was created for the bliss of souls like mine. I am so happy, my dear friend, so absorbed in the exquisite sense of mere tranquil existence, that I neglect my talents. I should be incapable of drawing a single stroke at the present moment; and yet I feel that I never was a greater artist than now.

When, while the lovely valley teems with vapour around me, and the meridian sun strikes the upper surface of the impenetrable foliage of my trees, and but a few stray gleams steal into the inner sanctuary, I throw myself down among the tall grass by the trickling stream; and, as I lie close to the earth, a thousand unknown plants are noticed by me: when I hear the buzz of the little world among the stalks, and grow familiar with the countless indescribable forms of the insects and flies, then I feel the presence of the Almighty, who formed us in his own image, and the breath of that universal love which bears and sustains us, as it floats around us in an eternity of bliss; and then, my friend, when darkness overspreads my eyes, and heaven and earth seem to dwell in my soul and absorb its power, like the form of a beloved mistress, then I often think with longing, Oh, would I could describe these conceptions, could impress upon paper all that is living so full and warm within me, that it might be the mirror of my soul, as my soul is the mirror of the infinite God!

The handcuffs weren’t particularly tight, yet they pinned my arms behind my back, making it impossible to get comfortable. Eventually I was able to maneuver until one shoulder was leaning against the rear door of the deputy’s patrol car, the other rested against the back of the seat, and my hands hung in the cramped space between them. I wiggled my butt, but it didn’t help. The seat was made of hard vinyl so that it could be easily cleaned—it wasn’t meant to be cushy. My fellow prisoner, his hands also cuffed behind his back, balanced on the edge of the seat and stared straight ahead with glassy and unseeing eyes. He looked walking-dead drunk. However, since he had spent the past few days in the Ramsey County jail being interrogated by FBI and ATF agents, I was betting on mild shock.

I turned my head to look out the window and watched a chunk of real estate whiz past, mostly forest. We weren’t in the North Woods of Minnesota quite yet, although we were headed that way.

“Deputy,” I said. He glanced at me through his rearview mirror. “What time is it?” His smile made me think he used one of those teeth whiteners advertised on TV.

“What do you care, Dyson?” he asked. “Got somewhere you need to be?”

“Humor me,” I said.

“Eleven thirty-five.”

I continued staring out the window.

She’s late, my inner voice told me.

I have a thing about punctuality, which means I spend a lot of time being annoyed. Waiting makes me grumpy if not downright angry, depending on whom I’m waiting for and how long. Nina says if I were less prompt myself I’d be a more agreeable companion. I suppose there’s something to that. On the other hand, if you say you’re going to be in a specific place at a specific time, then you should damn well be there. If I were wearing a watch, I’d be tapping the face with my finger by now. Only I had no personal possessions on me at all—just the orange short-sleeve jail scrubs and a pair of ill-fitting canvas tennis shoes furnished by the Ramsey County Detention Center.

I glanced at my fellow prisoner while pretending not to. He leaned forward until his head was pressed against the steel mesh curtain that separated the backseat from the front. He was muttering to himself. “Going to prison … never let us out…”

“You say something?” the deputy asked.

“No,” Skarda said—that was his name, David Skarda. We had never met; still, I knew everything about him. For one thing, I knew he wasn’t actually headed for prison, at least not yet. He was merely being transferred from one pretrial lockup to another—he was going to be tried in Grand Rapids, about 180 miles north of the Twin Cities, since he committed his armed robbery in Itasca County. He had originally been conveyed to the Ramsey County jail in St. Paul after he was apprehended as a convenience to the ATF and the FBI, which wanted to question him about the gun he was carrying at the time of his arrest. If he had been smart, he would have told them everything he knew. But he wasn’t and he didn’t.

Deputy Ken Olson—I wasn’t supposed to know his name, either, yet I did—drove effortlessly, like a man who had spent many hours behind the wheel. We followed U.S. Highway 169 as it hugged Lake Mille Lacs going north. There were far better, faster routes that led from the Cities to Grand Rapids, yet none of them was as scenic. And none of them narrowed to a single lane in just the right spot.

“What time is it?” I asked again.

“Why?” Olson said.

“Lunch. I hear they serve a nice buffet in the Itasca County jail.”

The deputy thought that was funny. “Relax,” he said.

“Relax, relax,” Skarda muttered.

“What’s this?” The deputy spoke while watching the action unfold through his rearview. A red Honda Accord came up fast until it was hard on his bumper, swung wide despite the double yellow line, and passed him on the left. He laughed as it pulled ahead.

“A blonde,” he said. “Some blond bimbo driving. Who else would be dumb enough to pass a police car illegally, and look at this—she’s going fifteen miles over the speed limit. If it weren’t for you two, I’d have me some fun.”

“Don’t mind us,” I said.

A moment later I could feel the car surge forward. Itasca County was in the process of retiring its fleet of Ford Crown Victoria Police Interceptors in favor of the more economical Dodge Charger the deputy was driving—if he had put the pedal to the metal, as the cowboys say, there would have been no contest. I saw Olson’s eyes flicker down and to his right, and for a moment I thought he might be running the blonde’s license plate on his onboard laptop. But then he sighed deeply, the Charger slowed, and he brought his full attention back to the road.
“Protocols,” Olson said. He spoke as if it were the saddest word in the English language.

The Accord followed the highway into a sweeping curve and disappeared from view. A few seconds later, however, we caught up to it. The red car was fishtailing in the lane, and my first thought was that it blew a tire and the driver was trying to bring it back under control. The red taillights flared, and the car pulled to the side of the road and stopped, its nose on the shoulder, its rear on the highway, blocking us. The deputy brought the Charger to a halt several car lengths behind the Accord and watched intently.
“What the hell is she doing?” he asked.

Forget what you’ve seen on TV and in the movies about inattentive guards who regularly ignore barking dogs; sudden, unexplained noises; and the odd behavior of complete strangers. In reality, most are trained to react—hell, overreact—to anything out of the ordinary, and they are never, ever taken out by a single punch or karate chop. The deputy, however, wasn’t one of them. When the blonde stepped out of the Accord he smiled brightly, showing all his teeth. I didn’t blame him. She was wearing the longest hair, shortest skirt, and highest heels I had ever seen. She tottered toward us, carrying a highway map that hid her chest.

“You’ve got to be kidding me,” Olson said. He put the Charger in park, opened his door, and slid out. “Lady, what are you thinking?”

The lady dropped the map. She was carrying an M26 Taser gun. She squeezed the trigger and two barbed electrodes exploded from the bright green nose, imbedding themselves into the deputy’s chest and flooding his body with 50,000 volts, all before the map fluttered to the ground. The deputy’s muscles locked up. He fell to the pavement like a square of shingles tossed from the roof of a two-story house.

The woman dropped the Taser, kicked off her heels, and went quickly to the deputy’s side. She squatted next to him, her short skirt riding up high on her thighs, and searched his pockets for the key to the handcuffs. She took the key, removed the Glock from the deputy’s holster, and padded purposely in bare feet to the Charger, where she found the latch that unlocked the back door. She moved as if every step had been carefully choreographed.

I slid out of the backseat and turned around. The woman unlocked the cuffs and gave me both the key and the Glock. I shoved the Glock between the waistband of my scrubs and the small of my back and followed her to the deputy. Olson was just starting to regain his senses as I cuffed his wrists behind his back. He said, “Huh, what?” while the woman and I dragged him to the patrol car.

“What are you doing?” Skarda wanted to know. His mood had switched from depressed to manic just like that. “What’s going on? Is this an escape? Are you trying to escape?” His eyes were bright with the possibility even as he flattened against the far door. “Take me with you.”

We ignored him, shoving the deputy inside; Skarda swung his legs up and away to give us room. The deputy shook off our hands and turned painfully until both his knees were planted on the floor of the car and his torso was folded over the backseat. His forehead was pressed against the hard vinyl as if he were using it to push himself upright.

“Stop this, stop it right now,” Olson said.

I slammed the door shut.

“Luck,” the woman said.

It was the only word she had spoken during the seconds—yes, seconds—it took to disarm the deputy. She gathered her shoes and ran to the Honda Accord. A moment later, she was motoring down the highway at a speed that invited arrest.

I slid behind the wheel of the Charger, shut the door, and put the vehicle in gear.

“You’ll never get away with this, Dyson,” the deputy said. His voice was hoarse and low.

“What did you say?” I asked. I accelerated down Highway 169 until I was going the speed limit and then set the cruise control.

“You’ll never get away with this.” This time he was shouting.

“I bet you say that to all the escaping prisoners,” I said.

“Do you think the police are asleep up here? You think they don’t know what you’re doing?”

“No, actually, they don’t know what I’m doing. That’s why I took your car instead of hightailing it with the babe in the red Accord, so some citizen wouldn’t see you parked in the middle of the highway and call it in. Time is my friend. It’ll be hours before the county sheriff knows what happened, and by then I will be far away from here.”

“This car is equipped with a GPS tracking device.”

“It is?” Skarda asked.

“Cops want to make sure they can recover their vehicles if they’re stolen,” I said. “Did you know some guys started a cab company in Detroit a while back using nothing but stolen police cars? God’s truth.”

“Dyson, listen to me,” Deputy Olson said. “We can still work this out. It’s not too late.”

I glanced at him through the rearview mirror and smiled. “Of course it is,” I said.

“Goddammit!”

“Hey, hey, hey—use your indoor voice.”

“What about me?” Skarda asked.

YOU AND I have something in common. We have both selected one of the greatest books ever written, Think and Grow Rich! by Napoleon Hill. However, it is almost 50 years since my mind was first exposed to the information that you are holding in your hands. The content of this book has the potential to improve the quality of your life to a degree that is very likely, at this time, beyond the scope of your imagination. You see, I probably know this book and what it can do as well, if not better, than most people alive today. Fifty years of studying the same book does something to you. Let me explain.
In 1963 my brother Al handed me a gift that I consider a true treasure. He gave me a copy of Think and Grow Rich! that he had bound in black Moroccan leather. Although I had already been studying another copy of the book for a few years, I have carried Al’s copy with me every day, everywhere I go, since receiving it. So much in my life has changed for the better since that day.
Just a year ago Al sent me an e-mail explaining how grateful he was that I began studying Think and Grow Rich! He went on to tell me that our entire family enjoys greater prosperity and joy today because of Napoleon Hill’s wonderful book. The philosophy contained in the following pages is one of the best perspectives on success that you will find anywhere. It has worked itself into our family’s way of thinking and into our way of living.
As I am dictating these words, I am sitting in my library surrounded by a few thousand books—great books, but none of them have had the impact on my life that Napoleon Hill’s Think and Grow Rich! has.
Henry Ford, John D. Rockefeller, Thomas Edison, and Alexander Graham Bell were a few of the people who were close friends of Napoleon Hill. Even without any research, you have a pretty good idea of the impact that the work of these great individuals has had on the world. We’re aware

 of their accomplishments because, in most cases, their name is associated with it. And yet, to my way of thinking, it is nearly impossible to accurately describe the positive impact that Napoleon Hill and his work have had on the world. Through his books, Napoleon Hill has transformed the lives of millions of people. Today, Hill’s incredible research and the organized information that came from his years of dedicated effort, percolate in the mind of countless millions of people worldwide—many of whom have never heard of Napoleon Hill. Yet these same individuals enjoy the wisdom that has been shared by others who have been impacted by Napoleon Hill’s great work.

When Think and Grow Rich! was first placed in my hands, I was sitting in a fire hall in a suburb of Toronto, Canada. I was a very confused, unhappy, and broke 26-year-old. I had virtually no formal education and no business experience. My mental focus was always on what I didn’t have, what I was lacking, and why I couldn’t do the things I dreamed about. However, Hill’s work inspired me; it caused me to focus on what I could do. As I studied the powerful information shared in this book, I began to search for ways of how I could do things, rather than why I couldn’t.
Think and Grow Rich! taught me to work at developing my strengths and managing my weaknesses. With the repetition of reading each chapter over and over again, I began to develop a healthy respect for my potential and my capabilities. Today I own a number of very prosperous companies that operate worldwide. I have attracted business partners with whom anyone would be proud to work. The LifeSuccess Group of Companies is focused on providing service in the same area in which Hill dedicated his life—helping people understand their potential and how to develop it.
I have formed the habit of reading a few lines from Think and Grow Rich! every day and have arrived at the conclusion that whatever challenge I may face, my solution will be found in the pages of this wonderful book. Another habit I have formed that I would urge you to follow is to read the chapter on “Persistence” every day for 30 days at least twice a year.
Recently, I traveled to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, to speak at the international conference of the Napoleon Hill Foundation, where the Prime Minister of Malaysia was presented with the Napoleon Hill Award. Although Napoleon Hill has moved on to the next phase of his eternal journey, the Napoleon Hill Foundation continues his great work. I clearly remember the moment I walked into the Foundation’s library, which houses

much of Hill’s original work. A deep feeling of gratitude came over me; I felt indebted to him and to the Foundation for the abundant life that I enjoy.
Make up your mind right now—make a firm decision that you are going to harness the philosophy in this book to do for you what it has done for millions of people all over the world! I strongly urge you to do as I did some 46 years ago, to read Think and Grow Rich!: The Original Version, Restored and Revised over and over again until it becomes a part of your way of thinking, your way of being. You will be richly rewarded for doing so.

BEFORE THE CLOSE of the first decade of the 21st century, America and the world faced a financial and economic abyss that came close to collapsing the world economic system. By most estimates, the meltdown would have been far worse—up to five times greater—than that of the Great Depression. Billions of people could have been ruined and hundreds of thousands of businesses destroyed.
Like ducks in a shooting gallery, one giant financial institution and big business after another teetered on the brink of disaster—Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Lehman Bros, AIG, Merrill Lynch, Bear Stearns, General Motors. Many failed. All were imperiled. We were facing an economic black hole. Today, for the moment, the ship seems to have righted, the “black hole” of 2008 avoided.
During the Great Depression of the 1930s there was born a cultural and publishing phenomenon that was tailor-made to help down-on-their- luck, down-in-the-dumps people survive the most trying financial difficulties. It was the landmark book Think and Grow Rich!, researched and written by Napoleon Hill during the Depression years. No book ever written had more relevance then, or has today, as Americans and other people around the globe continue to rebuild and strengthen their economies and try to plan for a personal economic future that despite many good signs and steps taken still remains uncertain.
So get ready. If this is your first exposure to Think and Grow Rich!, I urge you to stop reading at the end of the third paragraph below and turn immediately to “The Author’s Preface” on page 1. The beginning of a life- altering experience of the most profound kind awaits you there—an experience that has given thousands of men and women the key to success every year since Napoleon Hill first published this landmark work. What they learned helped many survive the Depression and many since then to go

 on to achieve great success and wealth in the years since those desperate times.
Think and Grow Rich! is the ONLY “how-to” book or other resource on personal success that you MUST have. It will help you grow rich—it will enrich your life—in all ways that matter, not just financially and materially. The ideas behind Think and Grow Rich! are the wellspring from which all “Personal Success” and “Positive Mental Attitude” movements have flowed. Every book, CD, DVD, podcast, speech, seminar, online resource or other product on personal success that has been produced since Think and Grow Rich! was first published does little more than rediscover or repackage Dr. Hill’s ideas and principles.
If you are reading Think and Grow Rich! for the first time, pay no attention for now to footnotes, the 52 pages of endnotes, and the appendices in this book. They contain information that will one day expand your appreciation for the book, but during your first reading, they will simply slow you down and interrupt your learning process. When you have completed your first reading (there will be many!) and thus begun your journey on the road to high personal achievement, financial independence, and true success in life, return to this foreword for the additional insights it provides into Think and Grow Rich! and the philosophy it entails. Study the endnotes, where you will gain further insight into such things as “Positive Mental Attitude,” the era in which Napoleon Hill worked and wrote, the people he wrote about, and Napoleon Hill himself. So again, I urge you, First-Time Reader: Do not hesitate. Waste no time. Turn to “The Author’s Preface” to begin your study—and DO IT NOW!
If you are not a newcomer to Napoleon Hill’s work and have already used another version of Think and Grow Rich!, a different sort of reward awaits you. The edition of Think and Grow Rich! you are now holding, as its subtitle indicates, is the Original Version, Restored and RevisedTM. Remember that Dr. Hill first published Think and Grow Rich! and the money-making secret it contains in 1937, at the depths of the Great Depression. In 1960, he published a revised edition of the book, which deleted many sections that appeared in the original. Much of this deleted material focused on specific matters related to the environment of a deep economic depression. These and other changes in the original manuscript were made so as not to “date” the book.

 Copies of the 1960 edition and its subsequent printings have, until now, been just about the only ones available in bookstores and most libraries since the 1960s. Ironically, because of the enormous economic upheavals, dislocations, and uncertainties that have swept America and the world since the near collapse of the world economy in 2008, much of what was omitted from the 1960 edition turns out to be amazingly relevant to circumstances and conditions that prevail today. Think and Grow Rich! in its original form speaks as clearly and meaningfully to people in the 21st century as it did to those who came before—and perhaps more so.
The version of Think and Grow Rich! you at this moment are reading restores the book to its original form by reinstating material that was edited out more than five decades ago. (A few original passages are not restored in the main body of the text because of their obsolescence, but these passages are fully quoted and explained in the endnotes.) In addition, the original “look” of Think and Grow Rich! has been re-created. The typeface used, combined with Dr. Hill’s creative use of italics and “all caps” words, gives a vigorous, enthusiastic “visual quality” to the text.
While this new version restores Think and Grow Rich! to its original form and look, the book has also been revised throughout. In every chapter there are minor changes in punctuation, terminology, and, occasionally, phrasing. Financial and economic data are updated where it made sense to do so (for example, using updated dollar values in illustrations and figures), so that readers will not constantly be forced to do in-the-head calculations to make comparisons. Each such revision of word or figure was made solely to remove any obstacles to a full understanding of Dr. Hill’s ideas. The goal at every step has been to make Think and Grow Rich! as user-friendly as possible for today’s reader.
This edition is revised also in that it is the first and only fully annotated version of Think and Grow Rich! ever published, the first with footnotes, endnotes, and appendices, and it contains the first comprehensive index to assist readers in using the book more effectively. Most of the annotations will be of interest primarily to the Napoleon Hill devotee who seeks greater understanding of the historical context in which Dr. Hill created Think and Grow Rich! While his message itself is timeless, many of the persons, events, and circumstances he discusses in his commentary and illustrations are no longer familiar to most readers. Think and Grow Rich!: The Original Version, Restored and Revised aims—in the sense of a

 “revised standard version”—to make all of these things as clear as possible without in any way interfering with or disturbing the integrity and message of the original work.
What to make of Think and Grow Rich!? Dr. Hill’s book is a publishing phenomenon. Year after year, people continue to “discover” it— tucked away inconspicuously on a bookstore or library shelf or passed along from a family member, friend, or associate—and they have read it, loved it, and used it to turn their lives around and their powers of creativity and imagination loose.
The first copy of Think and Grow Rich! was sold in 1937. Eleven years later, in February 1948, Coronet magazine polled 300 successful young men and women, asking, “What book or books most influenced your life and contributed to your success?” Think and Grow Rich! ranked fourth on the list. In September 1986—38 years and eight U.S. presidents later—USA Today published a list of the “10 top-selling paperback books about investments” in America for that month. Despite the fact that it is only in the most general sense an investment book, being primarily about investing in yourself and other people, Think and Grow Rich! ranked No. 1 on the list. (Books it beat? How to Buy Stocks, The Only Investment Guide You’ll Ever Need, and Getting Yours.)
Some years ago the Library of Congress conducted a survey asking what books most influenced readers’ lives. The top answer, by a wide margin, was the Bible. In second and third place were, respectively, Atlas Shrugged by Ayn Rand and Think and Grow Rich! by Napoleon Hill. In 2002, Business Week magazine published “The BusinessWeek Best-Seller List” in its October 14 edition. Almost incredibly, Think and Grow Rich! ranked tenth on the list of the current 15 top-selling paperback business books—65 years after the first copy of the book was purchased!
Walk into any well-stocked bookstore in America or check any online seller and you will find a few paperback copies of Think and Grow Rich! for sale (usually the 1960 version in one of its manifestations) in the business or self-motivation sections. Think and Grow Rich! endures because it works.
For three years it was my privilege to serve as the first editor-in-chief of Think & Grow Rich Newsletter, published by Imagine, Inc., for the Napoleon Hill Foundation, a charitable organization he had established. My experience in that position not only provided me with the insight and

 confidence needed to undertake this restoration/revision of Think and Grow Rich!, but also introduced me to the living power of this book in changing people’s lives. I was exposed to the kind of correspondence and phone calls that pour in daily from people throughout the world, in all walks of life and in all circumstances, who have read Think and Grow Rich!, applied its principles diligently, and attained self-confidence, self-understanding, and levels of success that most people only dare dream of. You may one day find yourself giving such a personal testimonial.
Yet there is more to Think and Grow Rich! than the power of the principles it explains. Part of the book’s appeal is the uncanny, almost prophetic insights of Napoleon Hill about matters and issues that are very much “today.” He talked about concepts such as networking, participatory management, excellence in customer service, visualization techniques, brainstorming, and the use of written goals and objectives long before any of these became corporate or psychological buzzwords—even before, in most instances, the terms themselves were created. He spends almost an entire chapter discussing the concept of mentorship, although he never refers to it as such and puts an unusual “Hill twist” on it. His speculations on human brain functions anticipate the whole area of right brain/left brain research. Any one of the numerous self-analysis tests scattered throughout his pages is thoroughly applicable today and well worth the price of this book alone. Fifty years before the word “downsizing” would come into vogue, Napoleon Hill spelled out in specific detail the perfect strategy and tactics to use when one finds oneself suddenly forced to look for a job or trying to start a business. His analysis of what capitalism is and means (in Chapter 6) is the most compelling and persuasive ever made and should be required reading for everyone.
No matter what town, state, province, or country you may live in, your personal success library will never be complete without this restored, revised, fully annotated, and fully indexed version of Think and Grow Rich! It contains all of the book’s original contents. It includes restored material that makes it more relevant and valuable to today’s economy than it was when it was first written. Teaching the practical steps to the attainment of financial independence and even great wealth is one of the main purposes of Think and Grow Rich! But it turns out that the greatest value of this wonderful book is not that it can make you financially successful, but that it

can help YOU, or ANYONE, achieve success however you may define it— and help you get whatever else it is that you desire from life.
To paraphrase Napoleon Hill’s most famous statement:
“Whatever, friend, you can conceive and believe, you can achieve!”
Think and Grow Rich!: The Original Version, Restored and RevisedTM shows you step-by-step just how to do it.

IN EVERY CHAPTER of this book, mention has been made of the money-making secret which has made fortunes for more than 500 exceedingly wealthy people whom I have carefully analyzed over a long period of years.
The secret was brought to my attention by Andrew Carnegie more than a quarter of a century ago. The canny, lovable old Scotsman carelessly tossed it into my mind when I was but a boy.1 Then he sat back in his chair, with a merry twinkle in his eyes, and watched carefully to see if I had brains enough to understand the full significance of what he had said to me.
When he saw that I had grasped the idea, he asked if I would be willing to spend 20 years or more preparing myself to take it to the world to men and women who, without the secret, might go through life as failures. I said I would, and with Mr. Carnegie’s cooperation, I have kept my promise.
This book contains the secret, after having been put to a practical test by thousands of people in almost every walk of life. It was Mr. Carnegie’s idea that the magic formula which gave him a stupendous fortune ought to be placed within reach of everyone who does not have time to investigate how successful people make money. It was his hope that I might test and demonstrate the soundness of the formula through the experience of men and women in every calling. He believed the formula should be taught in all public schools and colleges, and he expressed the opinion that if it were properly taught, it would so revolutionize the entire educational system that the time spent in school could be reduced to less than half.
His experience with Charles M. Schwab and other young associates of Mr. Schwab’s type convinced Mr. Carnegie that much of what is taught in schools and colleges is of no value whatsoever in connection with the business of earning a living or accumulating riches. He had arrived at this decision because he had taken into his business one young person after another, many of them with but little schooling, and by coaching them in

 the use of this formula, developed in them rare leadership. Moreover, his coaching made fortunes for every one of them who followed his instructions.
In Chapter 2 on “Faith,” you will read the astounding story of the organization of the giant United States Steel Corporation as it was conceived and carried out by one of the young associates through whom Mr. Carnegie proved that his formula will work for all who are ready for it. This single application of the secret by that young man—Charles M. Schwab—made him a huge fortune in both money and OPPORTUNITY. Roughly speaking, this particular application of the formula was worth six hundred million dollars* to the people involved.
* In today’s dollars, approximately $12.5 billion.
These facts—and they are facts well known to almost everyone who knew Mr. Carnegie—give you a fair idea of what the reading of this book may bring to you, provided you KNOW WHAT IT IS THAT YOU WANT.
Even before it had undergone 20 years of practical testing, the secret was passed on to many thousands of men and women who have used it for their personal benefit, as Mr. Carnegie planned that they should. Many have made fortunes with it. Others have used it successfully in creating harmony in their homes.
Arthur Nash, a Cincinnati tailor, used his near-bankrupt business as a "guinea pig" on which to test the formula. The business came to life and made a fortune for its owners. The experiment was so extraordinary that newspapers and magazines gave it more than a million dollars worth of laudatory publicity.2
The secret was passed on to Stuart Austin Wier of Dallas, Texas.3 He was ready for it—so ready that he gave up his profession and studied law. Did he succeed? That story is told too.
I gave the secret to Jennings Randolph the day he was graduated from college, and he would go on to use it so successfully that it carried him to a seat in the United States Senate and a long and distinguished career in public service at the national level.
While serving as advertising manager of LaSalle Extension University when it was little more than a name, I had the privilege of seeing J. G. Chapline, president of the university, use the formula so effectively that he went on to make LaSalle one of the great extension schools of the country.4

 The secret to which I refer is mentioned no fewer than a hundred times throughout this book. It has not been directly named, for it seems to work more successfully when it is merely uncovered and left in sight, where THOSE WHO ARE READY and SEARCHING FOR IT may pick it up. That is why Mr. Carnegie tossed it to me so quietly, without giving me its specific name. If you are READY to put it to use, you will recognize this secret at least once in every chapter. I wish I might feel privileged to tell you how you will know if you are ready, but that would deprive you of much of the benefit you will receive when you make the discovery in your own way.
While this book was being written, my own son, who was then finishing the last year of his college work, picked up the manuscript of Chapter 1, read it, and discovered the secret for himself. He used the information so effectively that he went directly into a responsible position at a beginning salary greater than the average person ever earns. His story is briefly described in Chapter 1. When you read it, perhaps you will dismiss any feeling you may have had at the beginning of the book that it promised too much. And, too, if you have ever been discouraged, if you have had difficulties to surmount which took the very soul out of you, if you have tried and failed, if you were ever handicapped by illness or physical affliction, this story of my son’s discovery and use of the Andrew Carnegie formula may prove to be the oasis in the “Desert of Lost Hope” for which you have been searching.
This secret was used extensively by President Woodrow Wilson during the First World War. It was passed on to every soldier who fought in the war, carefully incorporated or “embedded” in the training he received before going to the front. President Wilson told me it was also a strong factor in raising the funds needed for the war.5
In the early days of this century, Manuel L. Quezon (then Resident Commissioner of the Philippine Islands) was inspired by the secret to gain freedom for his people, and he went on to become the first president of that free island nation.6
A peculiar thing about this secret is that those who once acquire it and use it find themselves literally swept on to success, with what seems to be little effort, and they never again submit to failure! If you doubt this, study the names of those who have used it wherever they have been mentioned, check their records for yourself, and be convinced.

There is no such thing as SOMETHING FOR NOTHING!
The secret to which I refer cannot be had without a price, although the price is far less than its value. It cannot be had at any price by those who are not intentionally searching for it. It cannot be given away, and it cannot be purchased for money, for the reason that it comes in two parts. One part is already in possession of those who are ready for it.
The secret serves equally well all who are ready for it. Education has nothing to do with it. Long before I was born, the secret had found its way into the possession of Thomas A. Edison, and he used it so intelligently that he became the world’s greatest inventor, although he had but three months of schooling.
The secret was passed on to a business associate of Mr. Edison. He used it so effectively that, although he was then making only $12,000 a year, he accumulated a great fortune and retired from active business while still a young man. You will find his story at the beginning of the next chapter. It should convince you that riches are not beyond your reach, that you can still be what you wish to be, that money, fame, recognition and happiness can be had by all who are ready and determined to have these blessings.
How do I know these things? You should have the answer before you finish this book. You may find it in the very first chapter or on the last page. While I was performing the more than 20-year task of research which I had undertaken at Mr. Carnegie’s request, I analyzed hundreds of well- known individuals, many of whom admitted that they had accumulated their vast fortunes through the aid of the Carnegie secret.

These names represent but a small fraction of the hundreds of well- known Americans whose achievements, financial and otherwise, prove that those who understand and apply the Carnegie secret reach high stations in life. I have never known anyone who was inspired to use the secret who did not achieve noteworthy success in his or her chosen calling. I have never known any person to achieve true professional distinction, or to accumulate riches of any consequence, without possession of the secret in one form or another. From these two facts I draw the conclusion that the secret is more important, as a part of the knowledge essential for self-determination, than any which one receives through what is popularly known as “education.”
What is EDUCATION anyway? This will be answered in full detail.
As far as schooling is concerned, many of these individuals had very little. John Wanamaker once told me that what little schooling he had he acquired in very much the same manner as a steam locomotive takes on water, by scooping it up as it runs.8
Henry Ford never reached high school, let alone college. I am not attempting to minimize the value of formal education, but I am trying to express my earnest belief that those who master and apply the secret will reach high stations, accumulate riches, and bargain with life on their own terms, even if their schooling has been meager.
Somewhere, as you read, the secret to which I refer will jump from the page and stand boldly before you IF YOU ARE READY FOR IT! When it appears, you will recognize it. Whether you receive the sign in the first or the last chapter, stop for a moment when it presents itself and celebrate—for that occasion will mark the most important turning point of your life.
We pass now to our “Introduction” chapter and to the story of my very dear friend who has generously acknowledged having seen the mystic sign and whose business achievements are evidence enough that he discovered the secret. As you read his story and those that follow, remember that they deal with the important problems of life such as all people experience—the problems arising from one’s endeavor to earn a living, to find hope, courage, contentment, peace of mind, to accumulate riches, and to enjoy freedom of body and spirit.
Remember, too, as you go through this book that it deals with facts and not with fiction, its purpose being to convey a great universal truth through which all who are READY may learn not only WHAT TO DO, BUT ALSO HOW TO DO IT—and receive, as well, THE NEEDED STIMULUS TO MAKE A START.
As a final word of preparation, before you begin the next chapter, may I offer one brief suggestion which may provide a clue by which the Carnegie secret may be recognized? It is this: ALL ACHIEVEMENT, ALL EARNED RICHES, HAVE THEIR BEGINNING IN AN IDEA! If you are ready for the secret, you already possess one half of it, therefore, you will readily recognize the other half the moment it reaches your mind.

TRULY, THOUGHTS ARE THINGS—and powerful things at that when they are mixed with definiteness of purpose, persistence, and a BURNING DESIRE for their translation into riches or other material objects.
Edwin C. Barnes discovered how true it is that individuals really do THINK AND GROW RICH.1 His discovery did not come about at one sitting. It came little by little, beginning with a BURNING DESIRE to become a business associate of the great Thomas Alva Edison.
One of the chief characteristics of Barnes’ desire was that it was definite. He wanted to work with Edison, not for him. Observe carefully the description of how he went about translating his DESIRE into reality, and you will have a better understanding of the 13 steps which lead to riches.
When this DESIRE, or impulse of thought, first flashed into Barnes’ mind, he was in no position to act upon it. Two difficulties stood in his way. He did not know Mr. Edison, and he did not have enough money to pay his railroad fare to Orange, New Jersey, where Mr. Edison’s laboratories were located. These difficulties were sufficient to have discouraged the majority of people from making any attempt to carry out the desire. But his was no ordinary desire! He was so determined to find a way to carry out his desire that he finally decided to travel by “blind baggage,” rather than be defeated. (In other words, he went to East Orange on a freight train.)
He presented himself at Mr. Edison’s laboratory and announced he had come to go into business with the inventor. Years later, in speaking of the first meeting between Barnes and Edison, Mr. Edison said, “He stood there

 before me looking like an ordinary tramp, but there was something in the expression of his face which conveyed the impression that he was determined to get what he had come after. I had learned from years of experience with men that when a man really desires a thing so deeply that he is willing to stake his entire future on a single turn of the wheel in order to get it, he is sure to win. I gave him the opportunity he asked for because I saw he had made up his mind to stand by until he succeeded. Subsequent events proved that no mistake was made.”
Just what young Barnes said to Mr. Edison on that occasion was far less important than that which he thought. Edison himself said so! It could not have been the young man’s appearance which got him his start in the Edison office, for that was definitely against him. It was what he THOUGHT that counted.
If the significance of this statement could be conveyed to the person who reads it, there would be no need for the remainder of this book.
Barnes did not get his partnership with Edison on his first interview. He did get a chance to work in the Edison offices at a very nominal wage, doing work that was unimportant to Edison but most important to Barnes because it gave him an opportunity to display his “merchandise” where his intended partner could see it.
Months went by. Apparently nothing happened to bring the coveted goal which Barnes had set up in his mind as his DEFINITE MAJOR PURPOSE. But something important was happening in Barnes’ mind. He was constantly intensifying his DESIRE to become the business associate of Edison.
Psychologists have correctly suggested that “when one is truly ready for a thing, it puts in its appearance.” Barnes was ready for a business association with Edison. Moreover, he was DETERMINED TO REMAIN READY UNTIL HE GOT THAT WHICH HE WAS SEEKING.
He did not say to himself, “Ah well, what’s the use? I guess I’ll change my mind and try for a sales job.” But he did say, “I came here to go into business with Edison, and I’ll accomplish this end if it takes the remainder of my life.” He meant it! What a different story people would have to tell if only they would adopt a DEFINITE PURPOSE and stand by that purpose until it had time to become an all-consuming obsession!

 Maybe young Barnes did not know it at the time, but his bulldog determination, his persistence in standing back of a single DESIRE, was destined to mow down all opposition and bring him the opportunity he was seeking.
When the opportunity came, it appeared in a different form and from a different direction than Barnes had expected. That is one of the tricks of opportunity. It has a sly habit of slipping in by the back door, and it often comes disguised in the form of misfortune or temporary defeat. Perhaps this is why so many fail to recognize opportunity.
Mr. Edison had just perfected a new office device, known at that time as the Edison Dictating Machine (later the Ediphone). His sales staff were not enthusiastic about it. They did not believe it could be sold without great effort. Barnes saw his opportunity. It had crawled in quietly, hidden in an odd-looking machine which interested no one but Barnes and the inventor.
Barnes knew he could sell the Edison Dictating Machine. He suggested this to Edison and promptly got his chance. He did sell the machine. In fact, he sold it so successfully that Edison gave him a contract to distribute and market it all over the nation. Out of that business association grew the famous slogan “Made by Edison and Installed by Barnes.”
The business alliance was a great success for more than three decades. Out of it Barnes made himself rich in money, but he did something infinitely greater. He proved that one really can “Think and Grow Rich.”
How much actual cash that original DESIRE of Barnes was worth to him, I have no way of knowing. Perhaps it brought him two or three million dollars.2 But the amount, whatever it may have been, was insignificant when compared to the far greater asset he acquired in the form of the definite knowledge that an intangible impulse of thought can be “transmuted” into its physical counterpart by the application of known principles.3
Barnes literally thought himself into a partnership with the great Edison! He thought himself into a fortune. He had nothing to start with except the capacity to KNOW WHAT HE WANTED AND THE DETERMINATION TO STAND BY THAT DESIRE UNTIL HE REALIZED IT.

 He had no money to begin with. He had but little education. He had no influence. But he did have initiative, faith, and the will to win. With these intangible forces he made himself “number one man” with the greatest inventor who ever lived.4
Three Feet from Gold
Now let us look at a different situation and study someone who had plenty of tangible evidence of riches, but lost them—because he stopped three feet short of the goal he was seeking.
One of the most common causes of failure is the habit of quitting when one is overtaken by temporary defeat. Every person is guilty of this mistake at one time or another.
An uncle of R. U. Darby5 was caught by “gold fever” in the gold rush days and went west to DIG AND GROW RICH. He had never heard that more gold has been mined from the human brain than has ever been taken from the earth. He staked a claim and went to work with pick and shovel. The going was hard, but his lust for gold was definite. After weeks of labor, he was rewarded by the discovery of the shining ore. He needed machinery to bring the ore to the surface. Quietly, he covered up the mine, retraced his footsteps to his home in Williamsburg, Maryland, and told his relatives and a few neighbors of the “strike.” They got together money for the needed machinery and had it shipped. The uncle and Darby went back to work the mine.
The first car of ore was mined and shipped to a smelter. The returns proved they had one of the richest mines in Colorado! A few more cars of that ore would clear the debts. Then would come the big killing in profits.
Down went the drills! Up went the hopes of Darby and Uncle! Then something happened. The vein of gold ore disappeared! They had come to the end of the rainbow, and the pot of gold was no longer there! They drilled on, desperately trying to pick up the vein again—all to no avail.
Finally, they decided to QUIT.
They sold the machinery to a junkman for a few hundred dollars and took the train back home. Some junkmen are dumb, but not this one. He called in a mining engineer to look at the mine and do a little calculating. The engineer advised that the project had failed because the owners were

 not familiar with “fault lines.” His calculations showed that the vein would be found JUST THREE FEET FROM WHERE THE DARBYS HAD STOPPED DRILLING! That is exactly where it was found!
The junkman took millions of dollars in ore from the mine because he knew enough to seek expert counsel before giving up. Most of the money which went into the machinery was procured through the efforts of R. U. Darby, who was then a very young man. The money came from his relatives and neighbors because of their faith in him. He paid back every dollar of it, although he was years in doing so.
Long afterward, Mr. Darby recouped his loss many times over when he made the discovery that DESIRE can be transmuted into gold. The discovery came after he went into the business of selling life insurance.
Remembering that he had lost a huge fortune because he STOPPED three feet from gold, Darby profited from the experience in his chosen work by the simple method of saying to himself, “I stopped three feet from gold, but I will never stop because people say ‘no’ when I ask them to buy insurance.”
Darby in his day was one of a small group of fewer than 50 individuals who sold more than a million dollars of life insurance annually. He owed his “stickability” to the lesson he learned from his “quitability” in the gold mining business.
Before success comes in anyone’s life, that individual is sure to meet with much temporary defeat and, perhaps, some failure. When defeat overtakes a person, the easiest and most logical thing to do is to QUIT. That is exactly what the majority of people do.
More than 500 of the most successful individuals this country has ever known have told me that their greatest success came just one step beyond the point at which defeat had overtaken them. Failure is a trickster with a keen sense of irony and cunning. It takes great delight in tripping one when success is almost within reach.
A 50-Cent Lesson in Persistence
Shortly after Mr. Darby received his degree from the “University of Hard Knocks” and had decided to profit by his experience in the gold

 mining business, he had the good fortune to be present on an occasion that proved to him that “no” does not necessarily mean no.
One afternoon he was helping an uncle grind wheat in an old- fashioned mill. The uncle operated a large farm on which a number of black sharecropper farmers lived. Quietly, the door was opened and a small child, the daughter of one of the tenant families, walked in and took her place near the door.
The uncle looked up, saw the child, and barked at her roughly, “What do you want?”
Meekly, the child replied, “My momma say to send her fifty cents.” “I’ll not do it,” the uncle retorted. “Now you run on home.”
“Yes sir,” the child replied. But she did not move.
The uncle went ahead with his work, so busily engaged that he did not
pay enough attention to the child to observe that she did not leave. When he looked up and saw her still standing there, he yelled at her, “I told you to go on home! Now go or I’ll take a switch to you.”
The little girl said, “Yes sir,” but she did not budge an inch.
The uncle dropped a sack of grain he was about to pour into the mill hopper, picked up a barrel stave, and started toward the child with an expression on his face that indicated trouble.
Darby held his breath. He was certain he was about to witness a horrible beating. He knew his uncle had a fierce temper. In those days, poor children, especially sharecropper children, simply were not allowed to exhibit such overt defiance. When the uncle reached the spot where the child was standing, she quickly moved forward one step, looked up into his eyes, and screamed at the top of her shrill voice, “MY MOMMA’S GOTTA HAVE THAT FIFTY CENTS!”
The uncle stopped, looked at her for a minute, then slowly laid the barrel stave on the floor, put his hand in his pocket, took out a half-dollar, and gave it to her.
The child took the money and slowly backed toward the door, never taking her eyes off the man she had just conquered. After she had gone, the uncle sat down on a box and looked out the window into space for more than ten minutes. He was pondering, with awe, the whipping he had just taken.

 Mr. Darby, too, was doing some thinking. That was the first time in all his experience he had seen a black child deliberately master a white adult. How did she do it? What happened to his uncle that robbed him of his fierceness and made him as docile as a lamb? What strange power did this child use that made her master over this man? These and other similar questions flashed into Darby’s mind, but he did not find the answer until years later when he told me the story. Strangely, the story of this unusual experience was told to me in the old mill, on the very spot where the uncle took his whipping. Strangely, too, I had devoted nearly a quarter of a century to the study of that same power which enabled a small, illiterate sharecropper’s child to conquer a powerful figure of authority.
As we stood there in that musty old mill, Mr. Darby repeated the story of the unusual conquest and finished by asking, “What can you make of it? What strange power did that child use that so completely whipped my uncle?”
The answer to his question will be found in the principles described in this book. The answer is full and complete. It contains details and instructions sufficient to enable anyone to understand and apply the same force which the little child stumbled upon accidentally.
Keep your mind alert and you will observe exactly what strange power came to the rescue of the child. You will catch a glimpse of this power in the next chapter. Somewhere in this book you will find an idea that will quicken your receptive powers and place at your command, for your OWN benefit, this same irresistible power. The awareness of this power may come to you in the first chapter, or it may flash into your mind in some subsequent chapter. It may come in the form of a single idea. Or it may come in the nature of a plan or a purpose. Again, it may cause you to go back into your past experiences of failure or defeat and bring to the surface some lesson by which you can regain all that you “lost” through defeat.
After I had described to Mr. Darby the power unwittingly used by the little child, he quickly retraced his 30 years of experience as a life insurance salesman and frankly acknowledged that his success in that field was due in no small degree to the lesson he had learned from the child.
Mr. Darby pointed out: “Every time a prospect tried to bow me out without buying, I saw that child standing there in the old mill, her big eyes glaring in defiance, and I said to myself, ‘I’ve gotta make this sale.’ The better portion of all sales I have made were made after people had said

 ‘NO.’” He recalled, too, his mistake in having stopped only three feet from gold, “but that experience,” he said, “was a blessing in disguise. It taught me to keep on keeping on no matter how hard the going may be, a lesson I needed to learn before I could succeed in anything.”
This story of Mr. Darby, his uncle, the child, and the gold mine doubtless will be read by hundreds of men and women who make their living in sales. To all of these, I wish to offer the suggestion that Darby owed to these two experiences his ability to sell more than a million dollars of life insurance every year—an incredible feat in his day.
Life is strange and often imponderable! Both its successes and its failures have their roots in simple experiences. Mr. Darby’s experiences were commonplace and simple enough, yet they held the answer to his destiny in life, therefore, they were as important (to him) as life itself. He profited by these two dramatic experiences because he analyzed them and found the lesson they taught. But what of the person who has neither the time nor the inclination to study failure in search of knowledge that may lead to success? Where and how is that individual to learn the art of converting defeat into steppingstones to opportunity?
To answer these questions, this book was written. The answer calls for a description of 13 steps, or principles, but remember as you read, the answer you may be seeking to the questions which have caused you to ponder over the strangeness of life may be found in your own mind—which through some idea, plan, or purpose which may spring into your mind as you read.
One sound idea is all that one needs to achieve success. The principles described in this book contain the best and the most practical of all that is known concerning ways and means of creating useful ideas.
Before we go any further in our approach to the description of these principles, I believe you are entitled to receive this important suggestion: WHEN RICHES BEGIN TO COME, THEY COME SO QUICKLY, IN SUCH GREAT ABUNDANCE, THAT ONE WONDERS WHERE THEY HAVE BEEN HIDING DURING ALL THOSE LEAN YEARS. This is an astounding statement, and all the more so when we take into consideration the popular belief that riches come only to those who work hard and long.
When you begin to THINK AND GROW RICH, you will observe that riches begin with a state of mind—with definiteness of purpose and with little or no hard work. You and every other person ought to be interested in

 knowing how to acquire that state of mind which will attract riches. I spent 25 years in research, analyzing thousands of people, because I, too, wanted to know “how wealthy people become that way.”
Without that research, this book could not have been written.
Here take notice of a very significant truth: The Great Depression started in 1929 and continued on to an all-time record of economic destruction until sometime after President Franklin D. Roosevelt entered office. Then the Depression began to fade into nothingness. Just as an usher in a theater raises the lights so gradually that darkness is “transmuted” into light before you realize it, so did the spell of fear in the minds of the people gradually fade away and become faith.
Observe closely that as soon as you master the principles of this philosophy and begin to follow the instructions for applying those principles, your financial status will begin to improve and everything you touch will begin to transmute itself into an asset for your benefit. Impossible? Not at all.
One of the main weaknesses of the human race is the average person’s familiarity with the word “impossible.” People know all the rules which will NOT work. They know all the things which CANNOT be done. This book was written for those who seek the rules which have made others successful and who are willing to stake everything on those rules.
A great many years ago I purchased a fine dictionary. The first thing I did with it was to turn to the word “impossible” and neatly clip it out of the book. That would not be an unwise thing for you to do.
Success comes to those who become SUCCESS-CONSCIOUS.
Failure comes to those who indifferently allow themselves to become FAILURE-CONSCIOUS.
The object of this book is to help all who seek it to learn the art of changing their minds from FAILURE CONSCIOUSNESS to SUCCESS CONSCIOUSNESS.
Another weakness found in altogether too many people is the habit of measuring everything and everyone by their own impressions and beliefs. Some who read this will believe that no one can THINK AND GROW RICH. They cannot think in terms of riches because their thought habits have been steeped in poverty, want, misery, failure, and defeat.

 These unfortunate people remind me of a prominent Asian who came to America when he was a student to be educated in American ways. He attended the University of Chicago. One day President William Rainey Harper6 met this young man on the campus, stopped to chat with him for a few minutes and asked what had impressed him as being the most noticeable characteristic of the American people.
“Why,” the student exclaimed, “your eyes!”
What does the typical Caucasian say about people of Asian descent? We refuse to believe, or we think odd, that which is not familiar or
which we do not understand. We foolishly believe that our own limitations are the proper measure of limitations. Sure, another person’s eyes may appear “different” BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT THE SAME AS OUR OWN.
Millions of people look at the achievements of highly successful entrepreneurs, such as Henry Ford, after they have arrived and envy them because of their good fortune, or luck, or genius, or whatever it is that they credit for the entrepreneurs’ fortunes. Perhaps one person in every hundred thousand knows the secret of entrepreneurial success, and those who do know are too modest or too reluctant to speak of it because of its simplicity. A single event will illustrate the “secret” perfectly.
One day, Ford decided to produce his now famous V-8 automobile engine, one of the most successful developments in the history of the automobile industry. He chose to build an engine with the entire eight cylinders cast in one block, and he instructed his engineers to produce a design for the engine. The design was placed on paper, but the engineers agreed, to a man, that it was simply impossible to cast an eight-cylinder gas engine block in one piece.
Ford said, “Produce it anyway.”
“But,” they replied, “it’s impossible!”
“Go ahead,” Ford commanded, “and stay on the job until you succeed,
no matter how much time is required.”
The engineers went ahead. There was nothing else for them to do if
they were to remain on the Ford staff. Six months went by; nothing happened. Another six months passed, and still nothing happened. The engineers tried every conceivable plan to carry out the orders, but the thing seemed out of the question—“impossible!”

 At the end of the year, Ford checked with his engineers, and again they informed him they had found no way to carry out his orders.
“Go right ahead,” said Ford. “I want it, and I’ll have it.”
They went ahead, and then, as if by a stroke of magic, the secret was discovered. The Ford DETERMINATION had won once more!7 This story may not be described with minute accuracy, but the sum and substance of it is correct. Deduce from it, if you wish to THINK AND GROW RICH, the secret of the Ford millions. You’ll not have to look very far.
Henry Ford was a success because he understood and applied the principles of success. One of these is DESIRE—knowing what you want. Remember this Ford story as you read, and pick out the lines in which the secret of his stupendous achievement has been described. If you can do this, if you can lay your finger on the particular group of principles which made Henry Ford rich, you can equal his achievements in almost any calling for which you are suited.
You are “the Master of Your Fate, the Captain of Your Soul”
When poet William Ernest Henley wrote the prophetic lines, “I am the Master of my Fate, I am the Captain of my Soul,” he should have informed us that we are the Masters of our Fate, the Captains of our Souls, because we have the power to control our thoughts.
He should have told us that the universe in which this little earth floats, in which we move and have our being, is itself a form of energy, and it is filled with a form of universal power which ADAPTS itself to the nature of the thoughts we hold in our minds—and INFLUENCES us, in natural ways, to transmute our thoughts into their physical equivalent.
If the poet had told us of this great truth, we should know WHY IT IS that we are the Masters of our Fate, the Captains of our Souls. He should have told us, with great emphasis, that this power makes no attempt to discriminate between destructive thoughts and constructive thoughts, that it will urge us to translate into physical reality thoughts of poverty just as quickly as it will influence us to act upon thoughts of riches.
He should have told us, too, that our brains become “magnetized” with the dominating thoughts we hold in our minds. And that by means which no

 one fully understands, these dominating thoughts, like magnets, attract to us the forces, the people, the circumstances of life which harmonize with the nature of our dominating thoughts.
He should have told us that before we can accumulate riches in great abundance, we must magnetize our minds with intense DESIRE for riches, that we must become “money conscious” until the DESIRE for money drives us to create definite plans for acquiring it.
But, being a poet and not a philosopher, Henley contented himself by stating a great truth in poetic form, leaving those who followed him to interpret the philosophical meaning of his lines.
Little by little, the truth has unfolded itself, until it now appears certain that the principles described in this book hold the secret of mastery over our economic fate.
We are now almost ready to examine the first of The 13 Steps to Riches that underlie The Think and Grow Rich Philosophy. Maintain a spirit of open-mindedness, and remember as you read that these principles are the invention of no one individual. The principles were gathered from the life experiences of more than 500 people who actually accumulated riches in huge amounts—people who began in poverty, with but little education, without influence. The principles worked for these individuals. You can put them to work for your own enduring benefit.
You will find it easy, not hard, to do.
Before you read about The First Step to Riches in the next chapter, I want you to know that it conveys factual information that might easily change your entire financial destiny, just as it so definitely brought changes of stupendous proportions to two persons to be described.
I want you to know also that the relationship between these two individuals and myself is such that I could have taken no liberties with the facts even if I had wished to do so. One of them was my closest personal friend for more than a quarter of a century. The other is my own son. The unusual success of these two men, success which they generously accredit to the principle described in the next chapter, more than justifies this personal reference as a means of emphasizing the far-flung power of this principle.
Many years ago, I delivered the commencement address at Salem College in Salem, West Virginia.8 I emphasized the principle described in

 the next chapter with so much intensity that one of the members of the graduating class definitely appropriated it and made it a part of his own philosophy. That young man went on to become a distinguished member of Congress and an important figure in the national government. Just before this book went to the publisher, this U. S. Senator wrote me a letter in which he so clearly stated his opinion of the principle outlined in the next chapter that I have chosen to publish his letter here as a “foreword” to that chapter. It gives you an idea of the rewards to come.
My dear Napoleon:
My service as a Member of Congress having given me an insight into the problems of men and women, I am writing to offer a suggestion which may become helpful to thousands of worthy people.
With apologies, I must state that the suggestion, if acted upon, will mean several years of labor and responsibility for you, but I am enheartened to make the suggestion, because I know your great love for rendering useful service.
You delivered the Commencement address at Salem College, when I was a member of the graduating class. In that address, you planted in my mind an idea which has been responsible for the opportunity I now have to serve the people of my State, and will be responsible, in a very large measure, for whatever success I may have in the future.
The suggestion I have in mind is that you put into a book the sum and substance of the address you delivered at Salem College, and in that way give the people of America an opportunity to profit by your many years of experience and association with [those] who, by their greatness, have made America the richest nation on earth.
I recall, as though it were yesterday, the marvelous description you gave of the method by which Henry Ford, with but little schooling, without a dollar, with no influential friends, rose to great heights. I made up my mind then, even before you had finished your speech, that I would make a place for myself, no matter how many difficulties I had to surmount.

Thousands of young people will finish their schooling this year, and within the next few years. Every one of them will be seeking just such a message of practical encouragement as the one I received from you. They will want to know where to turn, what to do, to get started in life. You can tell them, because you have helped to solve the problems of so many, many people.
If there is any possible way that you can afford to render so great a service, may I offer the suggestion that you include with every book, one of your Personal Analysis Charts, in order that the purchaser of the book may have the benefit of a complete self- inventory, indicating, as you indicated to me years ago, exactly what is standing in the way of success.
Such a service as this, providing the readers of your book with a complete, unbiased picture of their faults and their virtues, would mean to them the difference between success and failure. The service would be priceless.
Millions of people are now facing the problem of staging a comeback,...and I speak from personal experience when I say, I know these earnest people would welcome the opportunity...to receive your suggestions for the solution.
You know the problems of those who face the necessity of beginning all over again. There are thousands of people in America today who would like to know how they can convert ideas into money, people who must start at scratch, without finances, and recoup their losses. If anyone can help them, you can.
If you publish the book, I would like to own the first copy that comes from the press, personally autographed by you.
With best wishes, believe me, Cordially yours,
JENNINGS RANDOLPH 9
What that commencement address had kindled in Senator Jennings Randolph as he was about to set out on adult life, was his first real understanding of the enormous power of DESIRE—The First Step to Riches.

Far far away, behind the word mountains, far from the countries Vokalia and Consonantia, there live the blind texts. Separated they live in Bookmarksgrove right at the coast of the Semantics, a large language ocean. A small river named Duden flows by their place and supplies it with the necessary regelialia. It is a paradisematic country, in which roasted parts of sentences fly into your mouth. Even the all-powerful Pointing has no control about the blind texts it is an almost unorthographic life One day however a small line of blind text by the name of Lorem Ipsum decided to leave for the far World of Grammar. The Big Oxmox advised her not to do so, because there were thousands of bad Commas, wild Question Marks and devious Semikoli, but the Little Blind Text didn’t listen. She packed her seven versalia, put her initial into the belt and made herself on the way. When she reached the first hills of the Italic Mountains, she had a last view back on the skyline of her hometown Bookmarksgrove, the headline of Alphabet Village and the subline of her own road, the Line Lane. Pityful a rethoric question ran over her cheek, then she continued her way. On her way she met a copy. The copy warned the Little Blind Text, that where it came from it would have been rewritten a thousand times and everything that was left from its origin would be the word "and" and the Little Blind Text should turn around and return to its own, safe country. But nothing the copy said could convince her and so it didn’t take long until a few insidious Copy Writers ambushed her, made her drunk with Longe and Parole and dragged her into their agency, where they abused her for their projects again and again. And if she hasn’t been rewritten, then they are still using her. Far far away, behind the word mountains, far from the countries Vokalia and Consonantia, there live the blind texts.

The Big Oxmox advised her not to do so, because there were thousands of bad Commas, wild Question Marks and devious Semikoli, but the Little Blind Text didn’t listen. She packed her seven versalia, put her initial into the belt and made herself on the way. When she reached the first hills of the Italic Mountains, she had a last view back on the skyline of her hometown Bookmarksgrove, the headline of Alphabet Village and the subline of her own road, the Line Lane. Pityful a rethoric question ran over her cheek, then she continued her way. On her way she met a copy. The copy warned the Little Blind Text, that where it came from it would have been rewritten a thousand times and everything that was left from its origin would be the word "and" and the Little Blind Text should turn around and return to its own, safe country. But nothing the copy said could convince her and so it didn’t take long until a few insidious Copy Writers ambushed her, made her drunk with Longe and Parole and dragged her into their agency, where they abused her for their projects again and again. And if she hasn’t been rewritten, then they are still using her.

The Big Oxmox advised her not to do so, because there were thousands of bad Commas, wild Question Marks and devious Semikoli, but the Little Blind Text didn’t listen. She packed her seven versalia, put her initial into the belt and made herself on the way.

When she reached the first hills of the Italic Mountains, she had a last view back on the skyline of her hometown Bookmarksgrove, the headline of Alphabet Village and the subline of her own road, the Line Lane. Pityful a rethoric question ran over her cheek, then she continued her way. On her way she met a copy. The copy warned the Little Blind Text, that where it came from it would have been rewritten a thousand times and everything that was left from its origin would be the word "and" and the Little Blind Text should turn around and return to its own, safe country. But nothing the copy said could convince her and so it didn’t take long until a few insidious Copy Writers ambushed her, made her drunk with Longe and Parole and dragged her into their agency, where they abused her for their projects again and again. And if she hasn’t been rewritten, then they are still using her. Far far away, behind the word mountains, far from the countries Vokalia and Consonantia, there live the blind texts. Separated they live in Bookmarksgrove right at the coast of the Semantics, a large language ocean. A small river named Duden flows by their place and supplies it with the necessary regelialia.

Pityful a rethoric question ran over her cheek, then she continued A wonderful serenity has taken possession of my entire soul, like these sweet mornings of spring which I enjoy with my whole heart. I am alone, and feel the charm of existence in this spot, which was created for the bliss of souls like mine. I am so happy, my dear friend, so absorbed in the exquisite sense of mere tranquil existence, that I neglect my talents. I should be incapable of drawing a single stroke at the present moment; and yet I feel that I never was a greater artist than now. When, while the lovely valley teems with vapour around me, and the meridian sun strikes the upper surface of the impenetrable foliage of my trees, and but a few stray gleams steal into the inner sanctuary, I throw myself down among the tall grass by the trickling stream; and, as I lie close to the earth, a thousand unknown plants are noticed by me: when I hear the buzz of the little world among the stalks, and grow familiar with the countless indescribable forms of the insects and flies, then I feel the presence of the Almighty, who formed us in his own image, and the breath of that universal love which bears and sustains us, as it floats around us in an eternity of bliss; and then, my friend, when darkness overspreads my eyes, and heaven and earth seem to dwell in my soul and absorb its power, like the form of a beloved mistress, then I often think with longing, Oh, would I could describe these conceptions, could impress upon paper all that is living so full and warm within me, that it might be the mirror of my soul, as my soul is the mirror of the infinite God! O my friend -- but it is too much for my strength -- I sink under the weight of the splendour of these visions!

When, while the lovely valley teems with vapour around me, and the meridian sun strikes the upper surface of the impenetrable foliage of my trees, and but a few stray gleams steal into the inner sanctuary, I throw myself down among the tall grass by the trickling stream; and, as I lie close to the earth, a thousand unknown plants are noticed by me: when I hear the buzz of the little world among the stalks, and grow familiar with the countless indescribable forms of the insects and flies, then I feel the presence of the Almighty, who formed us in his own image, and the breath of that universal love which bears and sustains us, as it floats around us in an eternity of bliss; and then, my friend, when darkness overspreads my eyes, and heaven and earth seem to dwell in my soul and absorb its power, like the form of a beloved mistress, then I often think with longing, Oh, would I could describe these conceptions, could impress upon paper all that is living so full and warm within me, that it might be the mirror of my soul, as my soul is the mirror of the infinite God! O my friend -- but it is too much for my strength -- I sink under the weight of the splendour of these visions! A wonderful serenity has taken possession of my entire soul, like these sweet mornings of spring which I enjoy with my whole heart.

But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and praising pain was born and I will give you a complete account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure? On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike men who are so beguiled and demoralized by the charms of pleasure of the moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee the pain and trouble that are bound to ensue; and equal blame belongs to those who fail in their duty through weakness of will, which is the same as saying through shrinking from toil and pain. These cases are perfectly simple and easy to distinguish. In a free hour, when our power of choice is untrammelled and when nothing prevents our being able to do what we like best, every pleasure is to be welcomed and every pain avoided. But in certain circumstances and owing to the claims of duty or the obligations of business it will frequently occur that pleasures have to be repudiated and annoyances accepted. The wise man therefore always holds in these matters to this principle of selection: he rejects pleasures to secure other greater pleasures, or else he endures pains to avoid worse pains.

On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike men who are so beguiled and demoralized by the charms of pleasure of the moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee the pain and trouble that are bound to ensue; and equal blame belongs to those who fail in their duty through weakness of will, which is the same as saying through shrinking from toil and pain. These cases are perfectly simple and easy to distinguish. In a free hour, when our power of choice is untrammelled and when nothing prevents our being able to do what we like best, every pleasure is to be welcomed and every pain avoided. But in certain circumstances and owing to the claims of duty or the obligations of business it will frequently occur that pleasures have to be repudiated and annoyances accepted. The wise man therefore always holds in these matters to this principle of selection: he rejects pleasures to secure other greater pleasures, or else he endures pains to avoid worse pains. But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and praising pain was born and I will give you a complete account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure.

In a free hour, when our power of choice is untrammelled and when nothing prevents our being able to do what we like best, every pleasure is to be welcomed and every pain avoided. But in certain circumstances and owing to the claims of duty or the obligations of business it will frequently occur that pleasures have to be repudiated and annoyances accepted. The wise man therefore always holds in these matters to this principle of selection: he rejects pleasures to secure other greater pleasures, or else he endures pains to avoid worse pains. But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and praising pain was born and I will give you a complete account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful.

Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure?

The European languages are members of the same family. Their separate existence is a myth. For science, music, sport, etc, Europe uses the same vocabulary. The languages only differ in their grammar, their pronunciation and their most common words. Everyone realizes why a new common language would be desirable: one could refuse to pay expensive translators. To achieve this, it would be necessary to have uniform grammar, pronunciation and more common words. If several languages coalesce, the grammar of the resulting language is more simple and regular than that of the individual languages. The new common language will be more simple and regular than the existing European languages. It will be as simple as Occidental; in fact, it will be Occidental.

Separated they live in Bookmarksgrove right at the coast of the Semantics, a large language ocean. A small river named Duden flows by their place and supplies it with the necessary regelialia.

It is a paradisematic country, in which roasted parts of sentences fly into your mouth. Even the all-powerful Pointing has no control about the blind texts it is an almost unorthographic life One day however a small line of blind text by the name of Lorem Ipsum decided to leave for the far World of Grammar.

The Big Oxmox advised her not to do so, because there were thousands of bad Commas, wild Question Marks and devious Semikoli, but the Little Blind Text didn’t listen. She packed her seven versalia, put her initial into the belt and made herself on the way.

When she reached the first hills of the Italic Mountains, she had a last view back on the skyline of her hometown Bookmarksgrove, the headline of Alphabet Village and the subline of her own road, the Line Lane. Pityful a rethoric question ran over her cheek, then she continued her way. On her way she met a copy.

The copy warned the Little Blind Text, that where it came from it would have been rewritten a thousand times and everything that was left from its origin would be the word "and" and the Little Blind Text should turn around and return to its own, safe country.

But nothing the copy said could convince her and so it didn’t take long until a few insidious Copy Writers ambushed her, made her drunk with Longe and Parole and dragged her into their agency, where they abused her for their projects again and again. And if she hasn’t been rewritten, then they are still using her.

The Big Oxmox advised her not to do so, because there were thousands of bad Commas, wild Question Marks and devious Semikoli, but the Little Blind Text didn’t listen. She packed her seven versalia, put her initial into the belt and made herself on the way.

When she reached the first hills of the Italic Mountains, she had a last view back on the skyline of her hometown Bookmarksgrove, the headline of Alphabet Village and the subline of her own road, the Line Lane. Pityful a rethoric question ran over her cheek, then she continued her way. On her way she met a copy.

The copy warned the Little Blind Text, that where it came from it would have been rewritten a thousand times and everything that was left from its origin would be the word "and" and the Little Blind Text should turn around and return to its own, safe country.

But nothing the copy said could convince her and so it didn’t take long until a few insidious Copy Writers ambushed her, made her drunk with Longe and Parole and dragged her into their agency, where they abused her for their projects again and again. And if she hasn’t been rewritten, then they are still using her.

Far far away, behind the word mountains, far from the countries Vokalia and Consonantia, there live the blind texts. Separated they live in Bookmarksgrove right at the coast of the Semantics, a large language ocean. A small river named Duden flows by their place and supplies it with the necessary regelialia.
